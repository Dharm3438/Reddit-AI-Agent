I had a hard life and earned every soft cuddly second of blissWho\u2019s gonna carry the boats?I\u2019m all for a comfortable and soft life.Please. Hardship is overrated.Yet another SEAL here to tell us how hard he is and why we should all think he's super cool and want to be like him. Yayyymaybe my life is supposed to be about making other people feel better with cuddles? There is something to be said about softness.At the root of this philosophy a question remains.\nTo what end?Y\u2019all don\u2019t get Goggins and it showsLol wth is this comment section bruh?worst most cringeworthy subreddit of all time strikes againWhat\u2019s funny about this mentality is that it assumes we haven\u2019t already been through shit.My favorite thing in school was always being told I \"had so much potential\".  I drive a forklift now.  It isn't glamorous, but my wife is a stay at home mom, my bills are paid in the first two weeks of the month, and I have never been happier.  Instead of pushing people \"to be great\" how about we push them to be happy?W DavidHustle culture is deadIt\u2019s the only thing that defines this dude. There is moderation in everything and peak physical shape isn\u2019t everything. It\u2019s like telling Einstein to stop working on general relativity and go for a 10k run instead.\"I like to get a bunch of men together. Men. That are the hardest of the hard. And I want to be with these men.\" \n-Gogginsone of my favs from him is \"on the other side of suffering, is greatness\".\n\nyou remember quotes like that when you're exhausted and you feel like things aren't worth it.Oh god I hope soI remember his Impact Theory interview and how it inspired me to get past my reserved introverted self and do better in pursuing business progression, relationships both romantic and nonSounds like \"alpha male\" bullshit to me lol.Damn didn\u2019t realize a sub that\u2019s called \u201cget motivated\u201d is shitting on David Goggins, a lot of you are pessimistic losers. Downvote me all you want .I know someone that needs to see this. In their late 20s, just got their first job out of college because they took so long to seriously start looking because they'd rather watch YouTube and pet the cat all day than start looking for a job. Sure, it's comfy to live at home and have your parents cook for you, but I can see the insecurity slowly set in as all their friends have moved out, have a half decade of career work behind them, and actually have some form of career goals. Fuck offffWhat good is that potential for if not for making life comfortable?This guy has to stretch for two hours a day because he caused permanent pain and injury to himself through overexertion. You shouldn't take his advice seriously on anything, and this boilerplate macho bullshit is dumb.Ahhh, David Goggins. The extreme physical turmoil version of doomsday preppers. There is nothing this man won\u2019t do to make himself and those around him as uncomfortable as possible.David Fucking Goggins. Helluva guy.Oh noStay hard mother &):)\u2019$&And whats the point of realizing your true potential? Everyone ends up 6ft under no matter how soft or hard your life was. As long as youre happy in the moment while you live your life who cares if its comfortable and soft?Isn't the goal ultimately be in a situation where you CAN be comfortable and soft?In Christ*Which apparently should be running as far as possible without rest.So what if I can run 10km longer than some other guy, that\u2019s not how i measure the worth of my life.I gotta be honest, I don\u2019t give a shit.I\u2019ve got the potential to be more comfortable and more softThis guys doesn\u2019t realise that people have different aspirations in life and not everyone wants to spend their time running around all day with their top offI worked hard for this cashmere life, David .Umm I worked so hard to get to this point, now its not good enough? FUHis wisdom and insight is not necessarily my wisdom and insight.Ha! I live a life so comfortable and soft, that I don't give 2 fucks about your potential.I feel like working himself to the bone is a coping mechanism for him, and he should realize that his experience and lifestyle are not universally applicable, instead those are what works for HIMAnd what will you do once you reach your full potential? Compete for two Olympics, then get force-retired, star in a couple of commercials, blow all your money on Lamborghinis and then become a drug-addled has-been who shows up once in a while to parties, makes weird jokes and leaves? No thanks, I'd rather stay at half potential and lead a normal life without needing to work 18 hours a day just to stay at the top.Seeking discomfort has little to do with success or outcomes but rather building resilience. Whether or not you are hit with hard times is not up to you in life. Its not in your control.\n\nWhere I am right now there\u2019s a multi-day power outage in a cold region.\n\nFor some, the inability to shower every day and a house where its 10C inside is a source of agony. For others, its not. What is the difference if not those that judge those things differently in ways that lead to different emotions?\n\nPrior exposure is always helpful. Voluntary exposure at regular intervals even more so.\n\nPlus, its helps cultivate a gratefulness and abundance mindset when you do have access to the soft things, while others may take them for granted.\n\nWith \u201cpotential\u201d I don\u2019t think it means \u201csuccess\u201d or the size of bank accounts or reputations. I think it means more the potential you have as a human within the space of human capacity for resilience, mentally and physically.best life ever bitchYes, but it's comfortable and soft, so I fail to see the problem...Fine with that.That danger is my goal.Sounds good to me!Gavid DogginsChildren are Starving, David.True potential to do what? Break bones in my feet from running for too long?This is one of the worst things I have seen on this page.This guys a toolRepublicans are making sure that is not the case for 95% of usI don't care about my true potential, if I can live a comfortable life without having to know that I'm better, I don't care, my life is good... Well in that case it is good, now it is just like that surprise egg that gives you a figurine toy instead of a buildable toy, the chocolate was nice, but man it sucks that it's just a figurineI wasn't gonna start drinking this early, but I don't want to dissapoint Goggins.Right ima take advise from David broken legs goggins xDSo what, when we dead it\u2019s irrelevant anyway. If you\u2019re enjoying yourself then you\u2019re all good.

Sounds like a life well enjoyedI love goggins but he needs to get laid.I think this guy is on drugs or something I\u2019m not sure why people find him motivationalFine by me. I've renamed my bed and my bedroom to The Pleasure DomeWhy  would I want to be uncomfortable? No thanks. I'm more of a why stand when  I can lay down while drooling kinda guy.A comfortable, soft life sounds perfectly fine but thanks.![gif](giphy|55itGuoAJiZEEen9gg)David Goggins is fucking mental and operating at a level of dedication to physical triumph that i dont take his motivation to heart.\n\nA comfortable life is a win so long as you're happy with it. Your potential might exceed where you currently are, but if you're cool with that you're in a decent spot.Someone send this to white people twitter.  They could use the reminderAt present I could do with a little less \"learning my potential\" and a bit more soft comfortCan't ever go wrong with Goggins mode.Soft and comfortable things and living up to your full potential are not mutually exclusive. This hard-man bullshit is so snoozer.After the last decade I've had, soft and comfortable is a dream. There is something to be said for security and routine after years of chaos and trauma.Oh no, how terrifyingWhy is it necessary to reach your true potential? Living content, happy and peacefully is enoughI'm alright with that. Oh no I'm soft and haven't given myself the best chance to fight me and  my family out of a apocalypse of some kindCounterpoint - many people chase their potential so they can live lives of comfort. Realizing your full potential is great and all, but why are you doing it? If you derive joy from it, good for you. Otherwise, why push further than you need to achieve comfort? Achievement divorced from context is just as hollow as indolence.You are in danger of misusing a comma so badly, that you will die without ever using correct punctuation.Guess ill never realize my true potential thenYou will die regardless so... Why bother?Isn't the goal to live a comfortable life?David Goggins, whoever you are, go suck eggsI like that kind of danger!When your big achievement is to be able to run for a very long time, you shouldn't give meaningful advice.I take comfortable and soft over angsty banalities any dayWhat an inspiration. I'm going to achieve my true potential in living so comfortably and soft.My back hurts... I don't think I'm that far off my potential.Which is to exercise a lot and become a YouTuber. Or podcaster.

I\u2019ve lived a damn hard life wishing for comfort.This guy is a complete idiot. Very few people leave comfortable and soft lives, and I'm sure those who do couldn't give less of a fuck about this.Don\u2019t be so f*ucking sure of that.That\u2019s the goalGoggins isn't the way I want to live life lol.

Don't post this idiot on hereI don't like seeing people like Goggins as motivational people to look up to. Sure I respect the guy for his hard work and the lives he's changed but his views and ideals and abilities are not attainable by the majority of people. This whole \"smash my legs with a hammer so I can go run this 10K, I want to be miserable in pain so I can earn my true potential\" is ridiculous.  I saw a clip of him in the early morning with his wife and they were on a dock alongside a little pond. David is bound at the ankles and has his hands tied behind his back then just jumps in the pond. You can see him squirming through the water in this weird swim technique to come up from air. His wife turns to the camera man and says that this was the most miserable thing from BUDS (drown proofing) so he likes to do it. I crashed a dirt bike coming down from a triple jump, slammed into the ground knocked me out and broke my clavicle. That doesn't mean I'm going to dive headfirst off a two story building to make me tougher.Bro i just want to chill and be happy...im fucking sick of anger , violence , wars in this world. All i want is love...and sure , comfort. Since i was born on this sick planet i only saw suffering , death , i was sick , skinny , abandoned , betrayed , at some point bullied. Let's say i conquered many of my fears/obstacles  but im done for real... all i want is love in all forms.I don\u2019t like how comfortable is connected to soft\n\nBut he\u2019s probably to folks like me anywayYou and I define danger very differently.I\u2019m just waiting for my AI overlords\u2026So many people shitting on Goggins to excuse their boring, frictionless lives\u2026 it\u2019s just crazy.Wish someone would give him the biggest slap on his bald head known to man. He is a disrespectful asshole masquerading as some sort of motivational speaker.Full potential for what? Sounds like he's selling something. I'd be glad to have a comfortable soft life. First world problems.Guide us Goggins \ud83d\ude4cDamBunch of soft ass motherfuckers in herewhat page is this", "[Method] Create an alter ego, David Goggins created Goggins. So, all that stuff you see him doing is when he is the mindset of the identity he created.$$[Method] Create an alter ego, David Goggins created Goggins. So, all that stuff you see him doing is when he is the mindset of the identity he created.\nNot uncommon with athletes either. George Kittle says he becomes the Joker for football games in order to get into the proper mindset.Todd Herman has a whole book on the subject: The Alter Ego Effect. It's a fascinating idea. I've seen some entrepreneurs using it very effectively to overcome shyness, imposter syndrome, lack of confidence and other mental roadblocks.Perfect, I\u2019ll channel my inner bulbasaur!Kind of like a \"Fake it until you make it\" mindset.Artists and Athletes do this all the time! Can definitely be beneficial but be careful not to let your alter ego consume you, especially if it incorporates your shadowSounds like good advice if you do NOT have co occurring mental health issues. When using this \u201calter ego\u201d approach I think Dissociation becomes a real concern. I used to create alter egos to cope with certain situations in life, but working through psychotherapy I\u2019ve realized my mental health was taking a big hit from dissociating from my surroundings, and then I had to face the process of reintegrating those \u201calter egos\u201d which ultimately were just false beliefs ingrained after years of conditioning.\n\nSo I would not be trying this. If you feel like your mental health is stable, then I\u2019ll say go for it. \n\nThose are my hard earned two cents, I\u2019m just a stranger on the internet :)Do you ever get the feeling that David Goggins is white-knuckling it? He's got no sense of moderation. I understand why he had to do that, but I don't think it's a model that most other people should follow. I mean, most people aren't going to run until their heart gives out. He's just on a different level for no real benefit other than he wants to be.\n\nHowever, if it helps somebody to create an alter ego to help their mind be less fragile, go for it.Watch Fight Club for inspiration.Has anyone mentioned how bad this is for your mental health? \n\nJim Carey is the best example. \n \n\nWhat if it becomes an addiction to switch character, every time things get hard, you end up confused, with no option to return to base when you want to\n\nI'm a big fan of goggins but found this a bit absurd. You can talk to yourself to get the best out of yourself, but creating alter egos I'm not so sure. \n\n\nWhere does your personality and and the alter ego begin?   You'll definitely need to see a psychologist down the line.Personally, i try to see the life as a movie or a tv show; and i as an \"actor\", perfome my act as good as i can; it really works for me.\"Fake it till you make it\" sounds so cheesy but actually is a great way to self-improvement.This ties in really well with what James Clear talks about in Atomic Habits. \n\nA powerful and necessary way to change your thoughts, behaviours, habits and ultimately results is to emulate the identity you need to achieve your goals. \n\nA simple example he gave was of a smoker trying to quit: you could say no I\u2019m not going to smoke because I\u2019m trying to quit OR no I\u2019m not going to smoke because I\u2019m not a smoker. The first option uses that assumption that you are a smoker and trying to change whereas the second completely shifts the baseline to a non-smoker. \n\nThis reframing will make it much easier to say no to smoking. Easy to see how this can be applied to anything (I\u2019m a runner, I am studious, I\u2019m a musician etc.). In a way it is faking it till you make it.For someone who's started reading Ego is Enemy, I'm confused.The ubermenschThis is what I already naturally do\nI never knew there actually was a name for itThis is excellent. I immediately came up with the perfect alter ego lol. Thank you!I love this. Listening to David Goggins first podcast changed my life to be honest. It's the first time a podcast or any audio media have had such a profound effect on me. It led me down the path to more Goggins and Jocko.Great idea! Beyonc\u00e9 has Sasha Fierce, why not create an super bad ass alter ego that helps you push through your own limitations and redefine/reprogram yourself? Love it! Thanks for sharing.Holy shit. I talk to different versions of \u2018me\u2019 in my head and I was worried I was a little cuckoo. But it helps me so much.  This post makes total sense to me.I love this idea!  And subscribed to your sub.Are there any guides on how to make an alter ego or do you just wing it?I do this. For me at least, it works wondersHis boy joey rogs loves this method too https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YTuElM6T50wI speak to myself third person all the time it works!The \u2018Batman Effect\u2019: How having an alter ego empowers you - BBC Worklife\n\nThe researchers had suspected that the alter ego would be a more extreme form of self-distancing, and the results showed exactly that. While the children thinking in the third person spent about 10% more of the total available time on the task that those thinking in the first person, it was the children inhabiting their alter egos who stuck it out for the longest of all. Overall, they spent 13% more of the total available time on the task than those thinking in the third person (and 23% more than those thinking about their behaviour in the first person).*Sasha Fierce has entered the chat.*The more I listen to Goggins, the more I think when he's fighting \"weakness\", he's actually fighting his trauma. This Goggins alter ego he created to be tough, sounds like a fractured personality part he needed to survive. This constant need to prove to himself he's not weak, stemming from childhood abuse keeps him going. I listen to him when I need to push that extra mile. His life story is motivational and he's helped a ton of people. Even he, a Navy Seal, is just dealing with his childhood issues in a way. On that note, I know he can do an ultra-marathon, but can he do a 30 or 60 or 90 day silent meditation retreat?Goggins' psyche is a little more complex than just an alter ego.  Personally, I feel it stems for the abuse he endured and witnessed as a child.  Based off his recollection of his childhood, his father was ruthless. His father was abusive.  His father was everything a father should not be to his children. I feel all if that is what contributed to who he is today. \n\nThere is more than just an inspiration to be a driven soul.  Goggins' story should inspire all fathers to be loving caring fathers who let their children be children.  There will be plenty of time to be a man later in life.I got the idea to dkk on this last month after a pirate documentary that talked about black beard and it has been doing wonders for me recentlyReminds me of the concept of subpersonalities in psychosynthes! Thanks for the post! \ud83c\udf40\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PsychosynthesisIs their a scientifically literate article on the subject. I love breaking things down to the bitter core and learning the very fundamentals that make up the bigger picture. If that makes sense. Elon musk talks about building from fundamentals and how it's better than understanding things on a surface level. Goggins talks about the same thing but without the science which is why I love that mother fucker. He just has that barbaric beauty that goes beyond science. I like both science and spirituality, I'll be looking for a decent article on the topic, if I can find one.Micheal Scott - alter ego - Micheal ScarnLost all respect when you mentioned marky mark lmao, he was a clown its not a good exampleIn one of his last interviews Kobe Bryant admits that before big games he would listen to the Halloween theme (yes, the horror movie) because he felt like Myers going cold stone killer against the guy he had to mark in the court.\n\nIt's insane how many things we find to use to switch mental states, from dressing differently to habits and even music.>Just like you can watch a fictional movie and not question the basic rules of physics and logic they break.\n\n\nYeah.... You haven't met me lolIt's a mode rather than a distinct personality sub type.\n\nYou go into a set mode depending on the situation. In an emergency, some people's default is to act others to hide. \n\nIn sport some get aggressive and become competitive and reveal the nasty. That is appropriate and makes sense, to win is the outcome.\n\nI think alter egos can be very misinterpreted in what they are and can also be an easy dissociative escape route from the real self, potentially endangering the stability of the core self.\n\nBut a very interesting topic area and cool post.[deleted]Why not just become the alter ego though?Jim Carrey too\n\n[https://youtu.be/2OYv6koH99Y](https://youtu.be/2OYv6koH99Y)I go by a nickname professionally for this very reason - I have confidence issues, but my nickname, she doesn\u2019t get nervous around people or handling expensive gear.This idea reminds me of code switching for some reason...Fuck yeah dude, glad to see your post doing well here. I second the recommendation of r/changemythought , excellent sub based on a quality bookThis sounds like a sure fire way to become a schizophrenicno I gotta disagree man. If this helps you, go for it. But Goggins gathered his strength from being his true self, ditching all bullshit and fake identities. Once he did that, and through suffering discovered his true self, he could do anything.David Goggins more like Tyler DurdenFrancois DillingerHe\u2019s also an ex seal who is fucking superhuman.

This is the only book you need to change your life.$$[Advice] David Goggins just wrote the greatest book on the planet for self-discipline. This is the only book you need to change your life.\nCan confirm. Good book.I was skeptical seeing all these extremely positive replies on this post, but after checking, practically all the usernames are older than several years.  Seems legit.  Went ahead and added it to my list on Amazon.Read this and atomic habits. This is way more inspirational.  [deleted]Goggins is the closest thing we will most likely see, to a real life Batman I admire him as well but his ruthless approach to improvement sometimes worries me. Seems like a perfectionist who shows no self compassion. I've never listened to audiobooks but would like to do this, can anyone point in a right direction? (would like to be able to listen through my iphone..)So I'm about 1/3 through the audiobook and while I do find his story inspirational, some parts of his mental framework bother me. I'd like to know how he regards mental/physical illness as its own limitation. He mentions once that before becoming a SEAL he was depressed... and I'm no psychologist, but it seemed like circumstantial depression rather than a clinical chronic condition. \n\nI'm someone who is striving for more self discipline but because of mental health issues, I'm already way too self-critical. Maybe I'm wrong, but his approach feels like blaming yourself for everything that keeps you stagnant. Mind over matter is great... but what if the matter is authentically something you can't fix or stave off?\n\nI'm all for pushing your mental habits out of their common negative stasis, but I worry that his perspective is too much for someone in a fragile state. I understand he doesn't disregard self compassion and that actually fuels most of his life change- but I wonder if it's harmful for people who already believe they're shit & start blaming themselves for not doing enough. \n\nI don't know. I'm genuinely enjoying the book but his\"no excuses\" approach feels too broad to be helpful. Sometimes reasons for someone's stasis are genuine, and it doesn't help if they look in the mirror and start blaming themselves for depression or bpd or a disability or PTSD.  Bought the audio book last week. 5 stars.Goggins is an absolute beast. Dude's never off the grind. Day in, day out, that guy puts in the work. Excuses don't fly with Goggins. He's a different breed. Very few have his mentality and strength of mind. He's a bad motherf*cker, no doubt. The thing I liked a lot is in the audiobook (I think) and/or possibly one of his more recent interviews/podcast (Rogan maybe?) He spoke straight about how many mornings he stares at his running shoes for 20 mins before he can shut his mind up from making excuses.. I dunno, something about that humanized it for me and made him seem more real. I've been following him since his original interview on Rich Roll.. I love him and his message but sometimes my own voice in my head goes \"yeah.. but this guy is a beast.. he's crazy..\" Even though in multiple interviews Goggins addresses people who say similar things about how our ego's and minds make excuses and put labels on others so we don't feel bad about our own laziness. \n\nI pre-ordered the book and said fuck it and got the audiobook as well - The audiobook - like many have mentioned - has additional  interstitial interviews... Definitely get the audiobook for the additional content. I still have a 1/3rd left to go but I love it. The only critique I have is that there are a few cringey parts when Navy Seals are talking smack.. I just found it cringey.. these very 'bro' moments.. But the message and content is worth it and doesn't bother me enough to not highly recommend it. I listened to his recent show on Joe Rogan Experience. That man is a savage.got the audiobook - loved it. Question ... Id like to have a summary of the challenges Goggins laid out in the book  without hunting back through the audiobook. Have googled / no luck. Does anyone here have such a reference? CheersThe whole time I was reading this I confused Walton Goggins with David Goggins and I was so excited. Bought it the 2nd he reappeared on Rogans podcast Definitely inspirational stuff. The only dude who could get me to actually implement the challenges he suggests. Get after it! I just got \"living with a seal\" and want to get \"can't hurt me\" once I'm finished.I've only read Living with a SEAL by Jesse Itzler (spoiler: this guy's the SEAL) and this guy seems basically insane. Should be an interesting read, but I'm not expecting something to base my life around.I listened to him on the Rogan podcast. Was a little put off by his endless cursing. Just seems he could get his message across better without that. Does the book have a lot of that also?Got my book 2 days ago and I'm already 100 pages deep which for me is huge! two hours in, really good stuff so far. setting up the accountability mirror this weekWhile many of us could use some self-discipline, Mr. Goggins seems like he may be....mentally ill. Incredible willpower and focus but to a degree that is not necessary....Honestly ... if you're not following David Goggins religiously are you even living life??\n\n&#x200B;Thanks! Will buy it and read it during the winter holidays. \n\n&#x200B;Had 3 Audible credits lying around. Just bought it. Thanks for the recommendation. I've been listening to it on my walks for the past few days. Kinda wants to make you run till you puke.Sounds like exactly what I need, definitely going to check this out!2nd time reading it nowThank you all for researching and recommending going to youtube the joe rogan podcasts later today. Maybe gift the audiobook for my guy (and kindle version for myself) Listened to this on the drive to family for the holidays and unfortunately it was pouring rain the entire time and nighttime. Was very hard to pay attention. Would recommend not listening to this in a stressful environment lol. That probably goes for all audiobooks but just kind of frustrating cause it caught my attention right from the beginning. Will probably restart over the holidays, can't wait to give it a proper listen!Can confirm.  In the words of Goggins \"FUCK THAT SHIT MAN\"\nAlso check out the podcast on JRE. One badass manJust dont listen to it when working out. His words not mineI read this when you posted it and just came back here to tell you that I got the book and the audio book, and I am 3/4 in and think this might be it. This might be the switch that changes my life! Thank you thank you thank you! I feel the same way, no book has had a greater impact on me and my behavior. I've listened to it 5 times now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCould you recommend any more books that are also impactful?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've read Jesse's book with Goggins, that was also great\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;Listening to this book at the moment and it is fucking awesome. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can triple confirm.The audio book has been incredible so far. I listened to the first few chapters last night of the audiobook. I can already tell that when I finish it, my brain will be completely rewired. Looking forward to it. I listen to the audio book on my long drives and it\u2019s amazing. Really recommend.Fastest Audiobook that Ive listened to. Ive read around 20Damn I just ordered this yesterday and I keep seeing great feedback about it. Looking forward to checking it out. He recently did an appearance on the joe rogan experience pod cast. Well worth the listen if your on the fence about getting the bookI am really enjoying the book, but the podcast parts of the audible book are hit or miss. A bit too much self-love for my liking, when really the book speaks for itself. Project slash.Just finished this audio book and can confirm great listen.  The beginning part of the book is a little boring for me, but if you can stick with it, it gets pretty insane.Much appreciated - Thank youJust finished the book yesterday. Its really good, sad that I'm done with it. Goggins is seriously a fucking animal and makes me feel pathetic when I finish my workout hahahMy recommendation for an intro to DG is:\n\n* Jesse Itzler \"Living with a Seal\" (audio book is fun b/c the author reads it  - with NY accent)\n* Joe Rogan Interview with David Goggins #1080\n* Jim Rome Interview with David Goggins #25\n* Joe Roagan Interview with David Goggins #1212\n* Then read \"Can't Hurt Me\" -- David Goggins (definitely do the audio book, it has extra stuff in it that's fun)Completely agree been listening to it for a bit now. Would recommend watching the Rogan podcast if you haven\u2019t either.He was pretty great on the Joe Rogan podcastI just learned about this man! Nice. Now I need it You just reminded me to buy itLove this mans passion. Il definitely get the book. Bought the book on Amazon a week ago.  Still no delivery date but I'm okay with that since I got such a great deal on it!Thanks, gonna get this one. Any other self help books that are good in audio form? In my experience, non fiction is hit or miss with audiobooks.Any good deals out there on the audiobook?This is so good. Thanks for sharing. He is so raw and passionate Thanks for the input. I may still check out his book. See if I can over look some of the language. He definitely has an interesting story. Thanks for the post. Just purchased the audio book can\u2019t wait to start listening.I heard about it but didnt know it was out yet. Thanks OP!Believed you and just downloaded audible. If you are right, I'll owe you a huge thank you[deleted]100%.  This subreddit should just be a link to the book's amazon page.
