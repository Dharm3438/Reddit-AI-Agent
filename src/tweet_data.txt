Digital Cameras, Smart Home Lighting, JABRA Bluetooth headphones, More!\nBULLISH\n\nEdit: BestBuy in shamblesWell how about that. After the MOASS there will be a big shopping trip to GameStop :)They also no longer carry AMAZON and GOOGLE products as all are listed at $0.00 and no info\n\nEdit: It's 4/20 and I had a moment of clarity between dabs.... Does anyone know if GameStop sold these items in the past or could these be a \"Coming soon to a GS near you\"?GME will start rivaling amazon and ebay at consumer electronics at this pace :DDefinitely buying after MOASS. Too broke right now.Sooooo smartWhen Europe?Big big update... Best one today[deleted]Dino Costume? TO THE MOON!!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Oh shit, I have over 30 Hue lights already and keep building. Will get mine here from now on.Move over, NewEgg.com!DAMMNNN .. if you are a supplier GameStop is awesome for it's wide distribution network and it's legend brand status. I am sure GameStop is making good supplier deals left and right.  Boomer heads exploding right now.So nice to see the Jabra Elite 75t, a nice product... Didn't know and I work for Jabra lol.if they start selling otaku stuff its game over, all the weebs will spend their hard earned tendies at GamestopThey are becoming a bestbuy and amazon at the same time. I love itBut they no have ps5 DXBullish AF!!!Are all these things actually available in us gamestop? UnbelievableI\u2019m sure Cohen and Co. are aware that an army of millionaire apes will be throwing money at them forever post-squoze.Can't wait for the Q2 numbers.IM SO FUCKING HAPPY I OWN THIS COMPANY!!!GG Best BuySeriously, who still buys digital cameras?\n\nEDIT: Today i learned im rich.Does anyone, who is more business savvy, know if a GameStop/PetSmart+Chewy Reward type system can be created where regardless of where you purchase from you will gain points towards a pool of reward points that you can redeem at any of the stores?\n\nExample: Say I play a lot of games so a good portion of my reward points are from GameStop type transactions and now I can use those points at PetSmart to say get a discount on a bag of cat food? I think that would be EPIC.Best Buy is now shorted 400%!Amazon better watch their back... there\u2019s a new sheriff in town...Currently building a new home. Guess I know where I\u2019ll be buying new TVsI have been saying to myself \"if only they sold tvs and sound bars I would buy my entire setup from them after the MOASS\"\nNow my dreams can come true\n \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80Gme can take all my money. Take it all\ud83d\udc02\ud83d\udc02\ud83d\udc02\ud83d\udc02\ud83d\udcc8I\u2019d love to see this transforming into the Saturn of the world, it\u2019s a store mostly in German speaking countries, I think media markt bought it now? No idea, I love that storeSo basically they are Best Buy?Bullish af!I sure hope they get a squad that will help me assemble all this in my home because I\u2019m a smooth brained ape \ud83e\udd13Imagine GameStop dividing in FoodStop, E-Stop, FashionStop, GardenStop, SportStop, etc.Thank you so much for the update fellow ape! \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffeNot hating or fud. But do people actually buy and use those kind of digital cameras?Vizio TV = Purchased.  PowerUp!could gamestop be part of the reason Bezos stepped down from Amazon?The world needs a general nerd/geek store.....Gamestop is the perfect candidateOhh shit I need a new TV and I actually like VIZIOSLove my jabra elite earbuds. Track heart rate, have a free fitness app for your phone. Case recharges them a second time (after 4.5hrs). More than happy with the sound quality. No problems pairing to i phones which plagues some brands.Hell yeah! I want to grab a new big ol' TV when I can finally get my PS5 with my tendies.They need to sell APE costums and not Tyrannosaurus\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udda7\ud83e\udda7Feeling cute, might buy more \ud83d\ude02Do they sell pool pumps yet? I need to get oneThey also have medical-grade air purifiers which ..once you get you won't ever want to NOT have one! They can clean up so much junk from the air you breathe into your body!Waiting on printers and toner.. especially toner, with 1 day delivery.  Instant sales to all nearby businesses once they put out the word.Damn, I didn't think they would actually take the step.  This is rocket ignition shit!AAAAAAA when in Europe Tooooo?!?!?!What about a large screen for trading stocks?They need to re design their website for online MerchOh shit. Yo I need a new printer and keep going to GS hoping they added some.I need a new tv.Best Buy's market cap is \"only\" $30 billion. Gamestop could get private equity backing to just outright buy Best Buy.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \nerection aside - is anyone buying an electric camera in 2021Is game stop the new RadioShack \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udda7If this whole movement was just one big ad to get GameStop thriving again... I\u2019m fine with that.Fuck of holy \ud83e\udd2fIs this serious????   Getting gamestop cards asapOh my, just in time for my basement upgrade to be completed around August.   I know now how to transform my living space and with whom!!!That\u2019s perfect I need a new TVThey should stack up on \ud83d\udc12 suits and masks, I'm sure many apes would buy this.I like it, bought 2 more shares.LET'S GO! If they add higher-end DSLR cameras then I'll be pissed that I just bought mine at BestBuy recently. Will make GS my new camera shop if they doIf they get the Phillips recessed lights I'll buy from them when I do mine in a couple weeks.Dude... that\u2019s fucking BULLISH\n\nTaking best-buy on pound for poundI like it but I hope it\u2019s not going the radio shack direction and going too far out of its nicheStarting to look like a Newegg rival.Watch out best buy/ amazonIs this just on the site or will some stores have this stuff?I'm in the market for a soundbar and one that fancied was VIZIO. Not too expensive and great specs, unfortunately it is very difficult to get VIZIO soundbars in the EU (stores and internet sites). Pissed...Are the prices competitive?\n\nAny VR/AR stuff yet? That would create an in-store experience and go well with their PC builds.Honestly this makes me way more excited holding the shares for the longterm outlook of the companyHow long until GameStop becomes the OneStop? \ud83d\ude0eI like the shop...I got a vizio v series from Costco when we locked down last year and I am very happy with it. Bullish.It\u2019s literally turning into Amazon...for electronics.I LOVE ITYea, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS! Bullish AF! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80J.A.C.K.E.D.This just in: GME offering exclusive pre-sales on Milly real estate plots to 'GME bag-holders'fuck boys, looks like my basement tv is getting an upgrade!Goodbye Bestbuy.. Hello Gamestop!sweetNot sure if we have different concepts of transformation, but selling random electronics online is not really the transformation? Just because they list a few new brands. Well that's nice. You can use ebay for that, no transformation needed \ud83d\udc4d. Don't get me wrong,that's still good news.Thank you for sharing this!Buy and hold.....Time is a friend....GME!!!!!Wow!  Sounds like they're trying to be a Best Buy!  Uh oh! :pFuuuuckk!!!they need to sell gorilla outfits next. fill the streets w em post squozzleSo we should diamond hand Best Buy after we moon???Thanks for the post just ordered a 70in with a soundbarJabra rocks. 10/10 would buy again.I\u2019m literally going to buy every single electronic thing I need via GameStop when I am setting up my new house.Goodbye GameStop shorting. Now we say hello Best-Buy puts. Now they need to partner with or buy out STEAM. This is the way.Yeah I was thinking more like streaming game service with exclusivity and deals didn't expect them to go toe to toe with best buy and amazon. I should have known better with R.C. at the helm.When the rock launches, I will support GameStop and spoil myself with these items.Can't wait for the tinfoil hat guys to come in and find the secret hidden messages in this like they did with the air purifiers. I'm gonna have to make a trip to the store, I'm almost out of tinfoil.I\u2019d go there because Best Buy is woefully inadequate.I have a both a vizio tv and a Samsung tv. Vizio knocks Samsung out of the park on picture quality.\nModels for reference - Vizio p-55-e1 and Samsung q65fnHoping they don\u2019t spread themselves too thin? This is a lot of expensive stuff to suddenly start stocking and have sitting on the books until it sells.BestBuy + Microcenter = New GME\n\nBULLISHThat's fucking dope. I. Like. This. Stock!Seems like they are overstepping the game part of their name, I think I should buy more stock!Good thing too, fry's electronics recently kicked the bucket due to pandemic. Im sure other electronics places are hurting too. GameStop could slide in that niche easy. All home/commercial entertainment needs.Wow look out Best Buy, Walmart and any other box box retailer. GameStop is coming for your jobs bruh...Buying a tvIs Vizio a good brand? I\u2019m searching for a new gaming TVSo who wants to short best buy?  \n\n\nAm I right?!I have one, great tv. Over two years old and no issues. Well except for the few months where I couldn't get Disney, but it's patched.Wow, they're gonna be like Fry's, but like... competent and user friendlyLet's go!! I was looking to buy a soundbar for my vizio tv. Now I definitely will!Dude wtf this is awesome, I'm about to move into a new place and I am buying all new shit and guess what it's all gonna come from GameStop! Let's go!!!LegendaryI just want a damn PS5.  Tell them to sell me one of those!My TV just broke today and my brother was recommending Vizio... what timing!!Excellent.Perfect for streaming set upMy 16 year old gave me $1500 from her to invest in VIZIO. Thank you GME!I have to assume this is just delighting the fuck out of customersgamestop already on pace to overtake amazonImagine them using warehouse space and hosting eSports tournaments tooomg if they start selling dyson hot + cool fans, i\u2019ll literally shit myself \ud83d\ude4cWhat next? Sex toys? BulllliishWe should crowd pool the Han Solo costume and ask the store to send it to RyanAnd RC hasn't even started yet. Just wait to see when the transformation is complete.New crew is working hard on the transformation.\n\nVery Bullish! \n\nHODL!Sounds like a JBHiFi store. \n\nI remember being a kid and putting a few dollar coins into the latest game at the arcade. It was fun but I always saved up for the Super Sunday Session! It was like $20 entry but the games were free for like 3 hours! My mates and I would fight it out; I wasn't very good but I didn't care. It was super fun!\n\nThen the Super Nintendo came out and the family couldn't afford one. It had the same new games that the arcade had and you could hire one from blockbuster video (and games). We pooled our lawnmower money to hire one weekly and practice. It was a good feeling going into the Super session and annihilating everyone with Blanka's special move. \n\nBy this time the Amstrad (which I still have) had been superseded by the commodore64 and the IBM (or IBM compatible). My first IBM compatible computer was a 486 DX 2 66. I used to get the olds to drag me around to my mates place with the desktop (we would rotate) to play Doom2. We'd modify the autoexec.bat and config.sys files to free up RAM........\n\nI just realised I'm old and rambling and if you got this far, you're probably old too. \n\nIn my opinion, selling items that people can buy cheaper on EBay isn't the best strategy for Gamestop, even with a 1 day rush. Gamestop needs to provide people with a place they can play together that trumps all others. \n\nA place where players come together, with the latest digital tech set up. A place where you can practice at home and pay to use the big boy toys for a few hours. Let's bring the fun back to gaming!I own a pair of Jabra 75T and they are really good\n\nBullish \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80If they are doing GameStop \u201cPrime\u201d in shipping and returning/refund service without hustle on customer\u2019s part, they will be new Amazon/bestbuy!Lopks like they are not going to be the Amazon of gaming but the actual next Amazon.UK Ape here, we have GameStop in Ireland but not in England - (instead we have stores like GAME and Gamestation) please expand and come to England so I have somewhere to spend my tendies after the MOASS and some unsuspecting employees to give obscenely large tips to!I will never go to Best Buy again and I\u2019ll only log onto NewEgg to laugh at how poor their inventory is compared to GameStop.comI dont know how I feel about this. I'm glad they are extending their online offerings but I really think they should focus strictly on games, it is Gamestop after all. Having all this additional crap up for sale only dilutes they're storefront and to me reminds me of one of those shady dropshipping sites that anyone can set up in five minutes.Probably a controversial opinion.... but I think they need to focus on GAMES and GAMING. I don\u2019t want GameStop to be Best Buy.... I am long and 100% believe in the company, but I think they should do one thing and do it well. Random household gadgets are not games...I hope they get into some virtual pornography NFT'sVizio TVs are old. Before Black Friday. \nSame goes for the cameras. They are also terrible. The rest of the products are overpriced items on the property of gaming and mobile devices. \nSource: customer that stalks GameStop for the past year +Cool, but this isn't what's going to get us to 100k+ per sharehttps://youtu.be/QyrDgEz3DR0 \ud83d\ude09[deleted]\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1a\n\nHOLD THE LINEHell yes brotherYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO@ me when they started selling weedHope they sell warranties for them ViziosThis is the way!!Holy shit. Let's go gamestop. Gme is legit killing it. Best buy is dead for sure now.\n\nI have a costco membership so I usually buy everything from there. But I've been constantly watching gamestop for shit to buy. They're getting close. BullishDidn't know you could game on that shit! Bullish AFAre they going to reinvent radio shack? GameShack. DiY to the players.I love it.This is the wayI don't know how to feel about the smart home and camera stuff... But anything else that goes back to gaming and the gamer ecosystem is great! With the clothes and costumes being an exception ofc that's like extras.Intresting!Comment.BuuuullllishHey RC if u are on this sub and are a quiet lurker please make gamestop in austria or europe the same as in the U.S i would love to give u some of my tendies for a new gaming setup/ gaming roomGamestonkI only own Vizio luv their ease and of use and software, now I know where I\u2019m buying my sound bar update! Their high end bar sounded amazing at BestBuyThey should delivery worlwide, need that Chewbacca moving mouth maskYeaaaahh like everything you could ever imagine in any way related to games?!  It's like RC cracked the code in one area of life and decided, ok it's time to play the game of games.  Power to the Players.holy fucking shitIdk if anyone mentioned this already, but they sell a ton of FUNKO stuff and fandom merchandise tooId be curious to see what percentage of sales electronics make up for amazon.If they add LG OLED TVs, put me down for one.I definitely like this stockChewy I\u2019m in!Out of that list why am I most excited for the smart home lighting? \ud83e\udd23 GME to the moon!FUCK YOU AMAZON, WE WILL FOREVER BE GAMESTOP CUSTOMERSI need a new tv for my Xbox series x but I\u2019m not a Vizio fan. I\u2019m at a crossroadsThe air purifiers is for all that weed we gonna be smoking happy 420 yallIf they where smart they would open up a 3rd party marketplace to reputable sellers like\nAmazon / Walmart . Collect 10-15% commission. fees for doing doing nothing essentiallyCrap. **Goes to buy another costume before Halloween...**Hmm. I\u2019m not sure if i like this trend. Gamestop was cool for its niche videogame scene. Action figures. Games. Systems. Seems like they should have expanded on that front. More things like boardgames, graphic cards, figurines. Now, it\u2019ll just become a bestbuy. A pile of poop wrapped in a pretty bow is still a pile of poop.Bless Ryan CohenHoly smokes! When Sonos?!I think with great products, great shipping speed , it is really a nice surprise. Probably they can add gaming tv series and try to capture viewership & expand into tv screens of households. \nIt would be a great to see if they expand into virtual and augumented reality space.Bought a Vizio M Series at the beginning of the pandemic. Best TV I've ever owned. Pretty good deal, too. Bullish.WHAT IF GME BUYS OUT BESTBUY!?!? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0fI could use a sound bar. \n\nI like the company\n\nI like the stock\n\nI hodlHoly fucking fuck fuck! Guess where my Tendies are going!wait gamestop is on the way to becoming the next amazon? BUYBull... ish.... as... FUCK !!!They really are taking Amazon absolutely head-on. Nifty that they have acquired a few critical Amazon execs to do so \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00afAww man, I get that they need to focus on US market transformation but I sorely wish there was a GameStop in UK. I'd love to be able to buy all I can from them!They've been selling tvs since at least january. Bought one from themThey need to start bundling battlestation kitsI bought a Vizio 75' 3 weeks ago on GameStop.com .its excellent !I know where to buy my next monitor and gpu!E-Commerce Best Buy. DopeI just bought a TV 2 months ago..... man I would b a shame if it broke and I needed to get a new 1... better yet time to upgrade every1s tvs in their roomsGameStop, the new RadioShack then \n? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffcI\u2019ve been meaning to buy a TV, if only they sold Samsung. I\u2019ll wait until they do! I will get that lighting kit though. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffdIs MSFT going to buy GME?\n\nThey could leverage the B&M footprint GME already has...  it could be MSFT\u2019s opportunity to compete with the likes of Apple\u2019s B&M, and Amazon\u2019s e-commerce presence.\n\nMost people don\u2019t realize Amazon\u2019s biggest business is AWS, not their e-commerce.  MSFT has their cloud business, just missing the retail side.Boomers: iTs a FailINg BrICK mOrTAr SToRe[deleted]I will buy are electronics\nThrough GameStop for my entire rich ass live. Power to the playersI like the stock. Feel me now?Vizio TVs suck tho. Hope they sell good TVs from Samsung or Sony. Vizio is Walmart trash.Sweet! They are starting to offer a lot of things I was already interested in buying! Smart, devices, new TV, sound bar. This is perfect! Gamestop could not make it any easier to support the companyI LOVE VIZIO!!!!GOOOOOOOOOOOOO Daddy RC..... Gamestop just keeps barreling forward like a freight train everyday something new I did notice no Ape Costume lolMore eGPUs and PS5 restocks next! \ud83d\ude4fStopBuyBestGameOh man they are fuking hf so hard \ud83d\ude80Amazon sells really shitty electronics. GME will crush them like a big.It looks like GameStop has ended this.", "My 9 years old Jabra bluetooth headphones exploded$$My 9 years old Jabra bluetooth headphones exploded\nMy guess is that's the battery that's gone. Modern rechargeable batteries only have an expected life of a few years, so it's not a surprise that it failed, just that it was so spectacular!That's a pretty good life out of a 9 year old headsetThanks, you're making me feel really safe today with my wireless headphones!You were charging it upside down so all the electrons spilled out.I think I see the problem. Your outlet is all round and strange looking.

I've had these for years too. I've replaced the battery once. They really are great headphones.

Yeah....[Unexpected GLaDOS](http://i.imgur.com/GSfXNlq.jpg)Death by auto-electrolytic asphyxiation.Woot woot 240V comin' through!Misread post: Thought some 9 year old exploded. Have you tried turning them off and on again?Bye bye magic smoke.lipo pack in direct contact with the PCB\n\nSomeone cheated on their CEThey had BT headphones in 2008?The golden brown hue on your wall is indicative of faulty house wiring. This has nothing to do with tech support.Seriously, contact Jabra.  They might have a known problem on this model and would be willing to send you a new one free or offer a substantial discount on a new headset.  Always worth the time to ask.ITT: people praising the fact that they lasted 9 years while ignoring the fact that they *fucking exploded*. How many time bombs are stashed in my closet...Have you tried turning it off and on again? Unplug it from the wall, wait 30 seconds then plug it back in.good thing they weren't on your head, otherwise it wouldn't just be tech goreI suspect \"engineered obsolescence\". I'm sure they never meant for those headphones to last that long.  Turn down the bass a wee bitLet that be a lesson to you. Don't use products for longer than their batteries lifetime.This is why i dont like having batteries near my head. That's surprisingly well contained to only leave a scorch mark on the wall.I see you bought the Russian model?that lasted well after warranty ended, pretty good deal.Jabra cadabra! And the headphones are gone!If I had guess, the better went. 9 years old, was bound to happen eventually. Lucky it didn't explode on your head.sounds okay, the wall was due for a wash anywayYou got VERY lucky here. \n\nThere was every chance the battery could have burst in to an exciting fireball and caused serious damage / fire. Mine exploded after about 3 years of use, while I was laying down in bed trying to sleep.  The one time I was very glad for my chronic insomnia.Headphones that lasted 9 years?

I bet you understood.At least it wasn't on your ear when it happened.I see you played my mix tapeI'm going to go ahead and say it, how ever unpopular: having Bluetooth waves constantly next your head for extended periods is bad.Please tell me you weren't wearing them at that momentThis is why you should get a proper pair of headphones with a proper bluetooth amp instead of some bluetooth headset.[deleted]Chinese crapMy bluetooth speaker recently exploded too.
