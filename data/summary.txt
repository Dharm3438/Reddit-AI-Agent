include ChooseCols, DMAX, Excel.CurrentWorkbook, FILTER, HSTACK, IF, IFS, INDEX, INDIRECT, LAMBDA, LET, LOOKUP, MATCH, NOT, OFFSET, PRODUCT, SORT, SUM, SUMIF, and SUMIFS. These functions can be used to filter data, sort data, add values, and perform logical tests. They can also be used to return specific columns, tables, and files.
