["Here is the summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nstart with structured courses and exercises, ask questions when stuck, use free resources like Python Programming by University of Helsinki, Harvard CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python, futurecoder, The Python Coding Book, and PyFlo; focus on a tangible project, build projects on your own, play coding games like bitburner; work on projects that you like, build things that you personally find useful or fun or nice; choose a single book and work through it; use the iterative approach, learn the basics you need to put your use case together as fast as you can, practice advance functions, learn OOPS and data structures; learn the bare minimum, incorporate necessary libraries for your use case, move towards harder bits; consider getting a mentor to guide you through, start with basics, learn syntax, build something by following a tutorial, then build something a little different adding your own flair; install any IDE and start coding.Here is the summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nPython courses recommended include The 100 days of code Udemy course from Angela Yu and the FREE Python course on crookshanksacademy.com. To improve online learning, it's essential to take notes, revise regularly, and avoid procrastination. The Chrome extension OneBook helps in creating detailed notes and saves time while learning. To learn programming, start with basic concepts, practice coding, and gradually move on to more complex projects. Make simple programs like min max, sorting, and calculator, and then move on to text-based games and complex games like battleship and snakes and ladders.Here is the summary of the solutions,

is the summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nHere is a summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions: having a few sources of learning helps to break up the monotony and keep you advancing, having a project you are genuinely interested in and a job you hate is a good motivation to keep going, picking a project you want to achieve, outcome-based learning may help as you get an actual reward for it, making a calculator that works out a specific problem, making an email sender, finding a matching tutorial to help solve a particular issue, finding an application for it that you're passionate about and jump straight into the deep end, starting with Sololearn, using Code Coaches, downloading an IDE, using Chat GPT, making a text adventure game, learning the basics then doing a project, doing a computer science intro course and actually doing the homework, finding a site that gives you prompts for simple apps you can make, starting with the basics and practicing consistently, using a 12-hour course to build the fundamentals and familiarity, and using a paid account for other purposes.Here is a summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions in a single paragraph:\n\nTo learn Python, install Python, learn the fundamentals, code along with tutorials, practice, practice, practice, join a community, take it slow, and don't get discouraged; once you've progressed, ask ChatGPT for tasks and concepts to learn; goals and purpose help with learning; use resources like Angela Yu's python course, How to Automate the Boring Stuff, and Jose Portilla's SQL bootcamp course; have a problem or task you want to solve to keep motivated; a combination of different resources, like Coursera and Harvard CS50, can provide a good base of knowledge.", "Here is the summary of solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nFree online courses with certificates of completion available at Harvard and MIT, including Intro to Programming with Python, and grad CS courses at MIT; setup links provided; course includes 20 hours of video training, 41 Python programming projects, and final project; takes a few weeks to complete; certificate itself considered somewhat useless by employers who value skills over certificates; having \"Harvard\" on resume generally not impressive unless an actual degree, online certs can be easily gamed, no accreditation, and little actual grading by professors; employers in data science field prioritize job applications and hiring over certificates.Here is a summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nPython skills are valued by employers, and learning Python can be a good way to get into the tech industry, even without a degree. The Harvard CS50x course is a free online course that can be taken at your own pace, and it's a good starting point for learning Python. Scratch is also a good resource for beginners. The course is available on a Chromebook, and it's suitable for people with no prior coding experience. The certificate is not necessarily worth anything professionally, but it can be a good way to demonstrate skills. The course is not limited to a specific time frame, and it's available for free. Python can be a good skill to add to a finance degree and move into the FinTech field. The course is compared to other resources such as Udemy and \"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python\". The course is available in English, but it's not clear if it's available in Spanish.Here is a summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nAmazon's ATA program was criticized for being unclear and inaccessible, but Harvard's Intro to Programming with Python was praised for being free and accessible. The importance of having a clear and concise way to describe skills on a resume was discussed, and the value of learning Python was highlighted. The discussion also touched on the idea of using online courses to learn programming, including those from universities like Harvard and MIT. The importance of daily practice to learn Python well enough to make a job of it was also mentioned. Additionally, the discussion covered the idea of using Python or R to automate tasks, and the accessibility of the course on phones and for people with no prior knowledge of programming.Here is the summary of solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nHarvard certificates for free, take the free edX course for python, sign up, even taking this course won't impact GPA, certificate is free forever, save this post, enroll in free edition, create a github, put your projects on github, recruiters take github projects into account, certificate has no extra consideration, can create example programs, debugging, using libraries, this course doesn't expire, this course is perfect supplement for learning python, try again, fuck, this course allows access to Udemy classes, certificates don't give a shit, augment with Udemy classes, recruiters don't care about certificates.Here is the summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions in a single paragraph:\n\nSome valuable certifications require a test/exam, suggesting not to waste money if you're only seeking education/information. Alison offers courses, but it's recommended to use reputable platforms like Harvard's CS50. It's possible to skip coursework and earn a certificate, but the value of these certificates is debatable.

Some languages like Golang, Kotlin, and Rust don't require semicolons. Python's lack of curly braces can be tedious to read and edit. Switching between Python and JavaScript can be fun. Defining scope and organizing code is important. Semicolons can be emotional closure. Joining the Scala, JavaScript, Golang club is an option. Fortran doesn't require tabs or semicolons. Perl and Python can be confusing due to lack of brackets or semicolons. Programming may not be for everyone. Python code looks clean but is interpreted. Kotlin is a good alternative. ES6+ JavaScript in a browser context doesn't require semicolons. Python feels weird due to its interpreter. Semicolons can be used in comments. Groovy programming languages are an option. Colons and tabs are everywhere in Python. Kotlin is good without Java boilerplate. Java and Python can be mixed. Rust has interesting semicolon behavior.Here is the summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nExplicitly writing semicolons in code can provide granular control and avoid implicit errors, but some developers prefer not to use them, especially in languages like Python where it's not necessary. Some users have different opinions on the use of semicolons, with some liking them and others despising them.", "Here is the summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nProgramming ability is not solely dependent on language skills but also on problem-solving and math skills math skills are crucial to understanding and developing algorithms and are a good predictor of programming ability in university-level programs learning programming is a whole different story from learning a programming language and requires acquiring problem-solving skills independent of the language chosen the study's findings are limited to measuring the ability to learn the basics of the language and do not reflect general programming ability learning syntax is important but has little to do with programming ability knowing a lot of words does not make someone a good writer and most programmers look up basic syntax every day fluid reasoning was the strongest indicator in the study and mathematics skill was not as strong a predictor as language skill but a more well-rounded measure of programming ability would include a combination of language and math skills programming is not just about language syntax but also about design macro-level thinking accuracy and organization ability to deliver and debug code efficiently.Here is the summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nProgramming skills are not solely dependent on mathematical skills or educational background, but rather on problem-solving, language skills, and ability to express oneself. Programming languages are consistent and can be learned with practice, whereas spoken languages are complex and have many exceptions. The brain engages multiple parts when doing math, programming, or other tasks, and it's not just about math skills or language skills. Key skills for a programmer include verbal and reading comprehension, written communication, abstract reasoning, self-directed learning, and perseverance. Programming is a tool for doing math, and it's not necessary to be good at math to program.Here is the summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nProgramming is not solely dependent on math skills, logical thinking and abstraction of problems are more important. Language abilities can be an advantage in picking up programming skills. The same parts of the brain are used for writing essays and writing code. Strong problem-solving skills and language abilities can translate to programming skills. Math skills are not necessary for programming, basic arithmetic is sufficient. Programming classes can be beneficial even for those with limited math skills. The study's sample size of 36 participants is small and may not be representative of the entire population. The study's findings may not be applicable to other programming languages.Here is a summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussion:\n\ncritical thinking is key to programming and many mathematical problems syntax and rules are language skill friendly but algorithms are pure mathematical problems understanding coding well enough to write maintainable code is crucial programming is less about syntax and more about algorithms mathematical problems can be solved with logical thinking and problem-solving skills language skills are also important for writing maintainable code critical thinking can be developed by taking unnecessary generalizations and trying to generate fact musical proficiency and cooking prowess can also indicate strong critical thinking skills and ability to learn multiple languages.Here is the summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nProgramming is not just about math, it's about problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and breaking down complex problems into small chunks. Math is not a hurdle unless you're doing scientific or gaming programming, and even then, there's a lot you can do without a strong math background. Python is a language with its own syntax, and learning it quickly is not necessarily dependent on being bilingual or having a strong math background. Good programmers are able to think algorithmically and write good algorithms and testable code, which takes longer to develop than learning a programming language.Here is the summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nunderstanding a language is key to understanding programming syntax and can be beneficial for programmers who are not experienced with math, foreign languages and problem-solving skills can be intertwined, mastery of words can make a programmer, language skills are more important than math skills, numeracy is not a strong predictor of programming abilities, abstract math skills are more relevant in programming, designing classes is similar to designing ring structures in abstract algebra, language skills can be just as important for programmers as math skills, humanities majors can still be good programmers, online courses on mathematics can be helpful for non-math majors, syntax of languages can be easy to pick up, problem-solving skills can be improved with experience.Here is the summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nThe discussion highlights the importance of language skills in programming and how it can be a barrier for those who are not mathematically inclined. It suggests that computer science programs in colleges should reflect this and not just focus on math. The thread also mentions the discovery of Noam Chomsky that human language skills are coded into our species and all languages follow a similar pattern, which could be groundbreaking. It also mentions that some research-oriented graduate programs put more faith in verbal and reasoning GRE scores than quantitative scores. The thread also shares personal experiences of people who struggled with math but have strong language skills and are interested in programming. It suggests that people should not be discouraged from pursuing programming due to math skills and that there may be a chance for those who are not mathematically inclined to still learn to code.Here is the summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nSome people think that math skills are not necessary for programming, especially for high-level, semantic scripting languages, but others believe that math skills are important for lower-level programming and complex, less human-readable code. A good programmer should have a mastery of a language, including English, German, Dutch, Chinese, or any other language, to organize their thoughts into words fluently. Knowing several programming languages and being able to learn new languages is also important. Math skills are useful for procedural calculation and algorithmic functions, but language skills are important for naming things and creating maintainable code. A good programmer should also have a good grasp of data structures and algorithms.Here is the summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nLanguage skills are important in programming as it requires understanding of syntax and frameworks, and people with good language skills can learn programming faster. Math skills and problem-solving abilities are also important, but not the only requirements for programming. Programming is a form of language and requires knowledge from all sources to do well. The study used CodeAcademy, which teaches using written language, and found that people with good language skills learn faster. The study reveals more about choosing the right teaching methodology than some generalization about who is good at coding.", "Here is a summary of the solutions, suggestions, and key points mentioned in the discussions:\n\nThe discussion revolves around the new calculator from Texas Instruments that can run programs written in Python, with some users expressing nostalgia for older TI calculators.
