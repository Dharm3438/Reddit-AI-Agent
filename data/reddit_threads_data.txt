["Mom of Vegas student Jonathan Lewis beat to death by mob outside school rips bullies\u2019 plea deal: \u2018Letting them get away with murder\u2019$$Mom of Vegas student Jonathan Lewis beat to death by mob outside school rips bullies\u2019 plea deal: \u2018Letting them get away with murder\u2019\nThe term \u201cmutually beneficial negotiation\u201d should not feature in a murder case\u2026They robbed someone and stomped him to death when his friend tried to get it back. They kid they killed was 17. They dropped the murder charge bc they are only 17. \n\nFucking clown world.Well that DA needs to be voted out. These kids are thugs and will 100% commit high level offenses in the near future.Pretty sure it\u2019s not \u201cmutually beneficial\u201d to the kid who\u2019s fucking dead.\"Fuck them kids.\"Max sentence of 4yrs is outrageous.[removed]\"Obviously, what occurred is a tragedy, but convicting these young men of murder would be a second tragedy, following the first.\u201d\n\nThey created their own tragedy. Now fucking deal with it. Rehabilitation is  very rare, and young adults or not they should have to deal with fair justice which in this case should be capital punishment but I would be happy with life in prison.There's no second tragedy in having them all go to prison. They deserve it. Fuck those bratsIf a teenager would kill my kid and the teenager wouldn\u2019t get life in prison, I would be pretty quick in prison afterwards.UnfairIf the races were reversed this would still be a headline story.that kid is dead and died a messed up death , all 4 should be doing LIFEThe next time they murder the DA should be charged as an accessory\n\n DA just wants to do the easy thing and not the right thing. No justice\u201cObviously, what occurred is a tragedy, but convicting these young men of murder would be a second tragedy, following the first.\u201d\n\nWhat the fuck?\n\nNo. Not it would not. \n\nFacing accountability for beating a someone to death is not a tragedy. \n\nThat\u2019s a dangerous train of the thought for your DA, of all people, to follow.Well, it\u2019s because of the races of the everyone involved. If it was reversed then the media would be all over it as a hate crime.[removed][removed]The real sad part is how little national media attention this whole story will get. But you know if a nerdy black boy was stomped out by white thugs and then given juvenile manslaughter charges. There would be nationwide riots.I don't think \"mutually beneficial\" means what you think it means... Also, \u201cObviously, what occurred is a tragedy, but convicting these young ~~men~~ (murder's) of murder would be a second tragedy, following the first.\u201d - REALLY? Would it actually be a second tragedy, or would it be \"Justice\". Imagine what this mother has to live with now for the rest of her life.If the races were reversed, the outcome would have been totally different, and everyone knows it.\n\nThe next step is responding to this aspect of the legal system.I'm not advocating violence but it really surprises me there isn't way more vigilante shit in this country. I'm not gonna say what I'd do if that was my kid that died because this is reddit and I'm sure I have a cuck that follows me around hoping I'll say something to get banned lol. Fyi if you're reading this it's happened three times and I appeal it and win every time so fuck you.Let me guess\u2026 not a hate crime (even tho it most certainly fucking is)If I could afford it, every f ing year on the anniversary of my son\u2019s death at the hands of these four \u201canimals\u201d I would publish their pictures and names along with the words convicted of murder just to fuck up their chances of employment in that community. I have loss faith in the justice system and if it is true that she was misled as to the nature of their plea agreement and not alerted to the hearing I would seek a higher court for intervention.Hate crimes should be charged as adult every time.Oh man, and if it was a black kid that was murdered by a group of white kids then it would be broadcasted everywhere. Tired of this shit\u2026I'm sorry. Explain to me how stomping someone to death is manslaughter and not murder. I have never heard of anyone being unintentionally stomped to death.If I read elsewhere correctly, the DA is a democrat? And if true, it\u2019s the one thing I seriously hate about that party is the relaxation towards crimes.[removed]If that was my kid they killed they would be praying for prison.   That's the only place I can't put a rope around your neck.   And even there id probably find a way to get to them.   Hopefully that kid has a lot of friends and family that own guns.I stole gas from a gas station when I was 16 and was charged as an adult ...... These mf's stomp someone to death and are not charged as adults?Makes me sick. That poor mom. My god.Jarvis, pull up who funded this DA\u2019s campaignIs this a hate crime \ud83d\ude24\ud83e\udd28\ud83d\ude22. This is heinous. I\u2019m a poc, I Fkng hate racism from all sides. \n\nSemper Fi, \n\nFrank \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8Trashy humans. Lock them up forever.This is what splinters society and creates vigilantes. I fully support revenge in cases like this.There would be literal towns burned to the ground and country wide looting if the races were reversed. You can downvote me into the ground, but in your hearts, you know it is true.Oh look, the pigs are incompetent once again.This story should be WAY bigger than it is\u2026. But it won\u2019t.Jesus fucking Christ. Any 17 year old that gang murders isn\u2019t a kid but a fucking monster. Send them to the firing squad.Sometimes you have to make matters into your own hands. Then the law makers will do their jobs.Could you imagine the riots if the 4 white kids beat a black kid to death?\u00a0Hmm.  Not a hate crime huhFuck I can't even imagine. This hits very close for me. My son is 16. He favors the kid who got killed\n\nIt may be wrong but if that had been my son and they let them off like that Id take care of them myself\n\nFuck it. Ill take my chances in court and if I go to prison then so be it as long as they were no longer breathingIt\u2019s not news because the victim was white and attackers were black.  Reverse this and there would be riots and real punishment metted out.What about hate crime laws?! This was obviously racially motivated.Look at those mugshots\u2026bunch of degenerates. Hope they will burn in hellThose animals belong locked up in chains where they belong.She should take care of it herself if the state won\u2019t. We don\u2019t need people like that in this world.Lock up those pieces of shit\nAwfulSeems racially motivated to me.Imagine the riots if the\u2026. No, I better not go there. #privilegeBlack on white murder being swept under the rug.Weird. It\u2019s almost like when you vote for liberals, you get a liberal attitude towards crime. Who woulda thunk itPretty muchMom should seek revenge, Dexter styleNow she can hunt them down one by oneClark County NV DA has a long history locally of pleading down violent offenders to save $ instead of going to trial, and keeping his \u201cconviction rate\u201d high for reelection time. \n\nOffenders with multiple violent felonies are routinely released and quickly re arrested out here. Happens all the timeSo murder is legal now. Got it. Jesus, my heart goes out to this mother. I can\u2019t think of the amount of rage I would be filled with.Honestly if it were my kid, what I would do next is kiss my wife goodbye and avenge it.Once they kill someone they are no longer \u201cbullies\u201d. They are murderers, and should be locked up the rest of their livesJohn wick x345654556 and last stop DA entire bloodline, dog and pet fish.Jesus Christ. Over headphones.Any time someone is attacked by more than one person they should be charged as an adult and as some type of mob attack which should carry a much higher punishment than when 1-on-1.Reddit wont care because the perps are minorities and the victim was white.fuck all these progressive DA'sWhy isn\u2019t anyone mentioning this could be racially motivated? Elephant in the room?That\u2019s insane, the girls in the slenderman case did years! The girl they stabbed lived, this boy died! I\u2019ll never understand the system!Leak their addresses.Mom needs to go Gerard butler law abiding citizen to all the people involved in making this dealSon for a sonImagine if the...rolls...were reversed. Cities would be burning and banners all over social media would be showing how much they care by changing in support to stop the...hate.[deleted]Jesus. Those kids all need to be in jail. They killed someone over what? Nothing.I'm just saying if someone kills my kid and gets away with it I'm enacting vigilante justiceWTH they all look like murderers.No shock thereThe 13%\u2026always the 13%Wonder how this would have gone if the victim were non-white and the accused were white...... HMMMMMMM????Yea, no. This needs to be reversed. This makes zero sense. It\u2019s flat out murder.WTF?! This is some bullshitDiD  rAcE pLaY A pArT?Those fucking losers will never reform from this. The look on their faces shows they know exactly what they did and will gladly do it again to protect their \u201cpride\u201d of being a man. The amount of hate that shows on their faces toward the camera proves all of that. \n\nThey are broken and undeserving of repair. They should be thrown in jail for life because they will 100% hurt innocent people and heroes like Jonathan Lewis when they get out at 19.\n\nNot only that but the internet is growing on people so much that it isn\u2019t letting shit like this be a forget and move on kind of situation anymore. People will push for this sham trial to be appealed and remind the judge the fact that they in trial for MURDER. A crime that does not deserve to get excluded just because it was a group of criminals instead of just one.\n\nThese criminals should not get away with blatant murderHmmmmmmm? I wonder \ud83d\udcad why???No one should be surprised.We all know why they got away with it. If it was 4 white kids stomping on a black kid. You bet your ass they would be getting life sentences with racial advancementsReverse the races and the country would be burningWhy wasn\u2019t it also considered a hate crime? If it was white people doing it to black people then it would be labeled hate and there would be protests and robberies all over the city. But when it\u2019s 4 black kids it\u2019s not hate and not a problem at all?![gif](giphy|S5bnO9ZubyLO2pYxDv)If I was a parent, this would for sure start my murdering spree. I'm not a parent, so we can all relax \ud83d\ude09Just letting those shit humans back into the world, only with more confidence to be a violent criminal bc they already got away with it once.This was a murder, on school grounds in broad daylight and this is the outcome? Honestly I would expect vigilante justice to start to proliferate if cases like this keep turning out without serious punishment. I mean we do live in a civilized society right? But when the people who follow the rules start to become the victims you better believe they will do what they can to protect themselves and theirs, especially when the State fails so many times. 2A rights are never going away in this country, and you can point directly to cases like this when people ask why.Won't be long before they slap their girlfriends around and abandon their unwanted children.\n\nWtf? Because their only 17, let's not do anything.\n\nYou're not only letting them get away with murder. You're also probably condemning some poor future souls that attempts to care for these monsters to a life of abuse and drugs. I don't see a future for these kids.. but any of them could be with your daughters because this sentence isn't long enough.Vegas is a cesspoolWhat evil ugly little bastards . This is happening in Europe tooI thought the *mother* was beat to death. What a confusing headline.Anyone maliciously beating some to death with video evidence should be tried as an adult. I could see if the kid got hit once and hit his head and he died. I could understand leniency. But this?! Nah man. I couldnt let this go if this was my kid.Should have been charged as a hate crimeWhat a shocker, a democratic DA is letting more murders off with a slap on the wrist.Oh bc he\u2019s white and they\u2019re black and this reparations and liberal judges and DAs that won\u2019t prosecute. It\u2019s rigged manWe've been catering to the lowest common denominator for a decade, and now we've become a trash society.They look exactly like how you would imagine them to look.ACDJAB\n\nAll Cops, DAs, and Judges Are BadDemocrat leadership and liberal DAs are the reason for this. There are no consequences for actions. There is a video of this murder. It is horrible in every sense of the word. These killers have no value of human life. We will see more consequences in the future.The fuck did you expect from voting for the \"Fuck white people\" party?The DA is Melissa Inlow. Idk if she is the one handling it, but she is the DA.Vegas is a Hell-Hole.Like an infected pustule in the desert,sucking up water and power from places that SUPPORT life.That's the problem w today's youth,from adolescence on they suffer no consequences for their actions. If these punk thugs would've known discipline in their adolescence then we aren't having this conversationThose kids don\u2019t belong on the streets. Bottom line. Fucking disgustingI hope folks don't let this story die. This was great injustice. How trash do you have to be to 1 v 12 a guy like this. I would push these waste of oxygen overboard if I could.Yes let's try and reform a group of thugs that stole a kid's headphones and beat him to death after he confronted them. I wonder what their response will be to a real problem? I wonder how many people are currently in jail for over 2 years for only posessing weed. Clown world justice system. If i was that mom, i'd be loading a gun and finding home addresses.WTF??? Maybe handing it over to the Feds?AThey should be strung up and left outside to rot.Spread this kids face everywhere and don\u2019t let them forget. Hopefully we can punish this shit bag in other ways if the government won\u2019t.Sure they learned their lesson and will be on the straight and narrow moving forward /s. My guess is these kids will all be dead or in jail before 25.How do they not expect loved ones to take matters into their own handsWho is the DA? Get their name out thereIt is insane to think that at 17 a person is too young to be a tried as an adult, and only a year later they are old enough to be soldiers. 1-10 for murder\u2026No videos of the attack?The Draskovich Law Group is representing these killersall 4 should die in prisonThis makes me so fucking angry im logging off social media. If i was the mom, id be going to prison soon thats all ill sayIf something happens to me please don\u2019t let the media use my bad picturesThey will be incarcerated soon in there pathetic lives. We all know it. Just delaying the inevitable, just more time to ruin more lives.. our justice system is a joke. I would love to have there parents or grandparents or whoever is responsible for there fucking animals be held accountable also.. fuck em all. POS fucking trash..Kid died standing up to someone stealing his friend's airpods.    4 years with a clean record after isnt a fair judgement.Just a question but how can non-adults be charged as adults whilst not having the rights of an adult?Are you fucking kidding me? There is clear video evidence! Why the fuck are they making a deal? It\u2019s not like they needed to make a deal to confirm identities.How is convicting people of murder when there is video proof of the murder a \u201csecond tragedy\u201d!?Don\u2019t worry they\u2019ll be back time and time again until they stop being released or die.This mother should be facing life in prison after hearing that. If it was me, those kids wouldn't be here anymore either.They'll be gang members within a yearLock those  assholes up.\u201cObviously, what occurred is a tragedy, but convicting these young men of murder would be a second tragedy, following the first.\u201d\n\nWhat the fuck is this dogshit?! THE SECOND TRAGEDY IS REFUSING TO CONVICT THE MURDERERS OF MURDER.Law abiding citizen timePeople keep voting these clowns in. Every progressive DA is failing miserablyDoes the Judge and DA pat her on the back and say things like \"I know this is hard but this is how the justice system works\"? Then go play golf together. Straight up out of a movie.There should be a follow up story 5-10 years from now, to see how much of an asset these individuals are for society and how much mu society is gaining from their inclusion.Thanks \u201crestorative justice\u201d. Let\u2019s give these men some gubmint checks.You can call the DA whatever you want, but you can\u2019t call them racist.Those are the 4 ugliest boys I've ever seenThis was clearly a racially motivated hate crime!!!Plea deal-  wtf - these kids will be back for something and the next judge is going to take it out of them something fierce -  oj second charge and penalty was mostly for the 1st crime-\n\nCan\u2019t wait for them to get BACK to jail\n\n![gif](giphy|14xevsb9mhsqmk)Those kids should have no freedom after taking that poor kids lifeSo when she mows them down in her car will she also get a plea deal? I don't understand how people can expect people to just accept rulings like this when your family has been murdered.What we need is vigilantes, it'll happen sooner or later, people are getting sick of thispathetic, they are the perfect choice FOR being tried as an adult. WTF is wrong with the DA.Well, when they get out, find them and let them experience what they did. You want justice? Make it happen.I mean\u2026. You guys know where they are. Let them get out of going to jail. Makes it better for \u2026 other arrangements.I\u2019d go ahead and serve some justice up myself if I was this poor ladyIf those we charge with seeking justice can't find it the people must. Can we bring back tar and feathering? Maybe the stockade tooMay God be with you at this time\n\n\nLois WLet\u2019s hope for some karma justiceWhat a poorly written headlineTypical \"justice\" systemThose four are pieces of shit that came from pieces of shit. They will never amount to anything. Like their parents.These animals aren\u2019t gonna be rehabilitated in four years or less. This is absurd.What a shame. Annoys me how they let people get off easy just cause they are younger than 18. And then if you do anything to them you get in trouble so you got all these kids running around being little menaces knowing that and they use it to their advantage.This is insane. That poor mom have to grief the brutal killing of her child, and now the punks who did it get a good deal. Seriously, Fuck that DA\u201cJust a reminder, this station does not endorse vigilante justice. Unless it gets results.\u201d -Simpsons news anchorThe murderous dumbass foursome should be in jail and not freed. What is wrong with the justice system\u00a0That is such a shoddily written headline, I thought it was saying the mom was also beaten to death!\u201cWe were able to evaluate all the evidence as a whole and reach this mutually beneficial negotiation,\u201dIf I was the parent, I would take matters into my own hands, even it took years, someone murders my kid, a \u201cplea bargain for juvenile manslaughter charges\u201d is not going to work for me.Good job \"justice system\" another failed outcome.They played the disenfranchised minority card. What a joke.Not a good look. *sip*Sometimes you have to take justice into your own handsIf the victim had someone defended himself he'd for sure be in prison for life. But since he died, everyone gets a free walk.The justice system is about taking actions that have the greatest probability of keeping the public safe.  Unless the DA doesn't have the evidence to convict, this plea bargain certainly doesn't keep the public safe.They will kill again\u2026put all these ones up for murder and ontop of that domestic terrorism. Put them away. I hate how they allow crap like this. They beat a person to death. That is murder. They are 17\u2026 that\u2019s an adult in most places. In Vegas, age of consent is 16, they ain\u2019t kids according to their state laws. Soooo give them max years under the law for murder.DA needs firing immediately.She need to civilly sue them and there parents - bankruptcy is a great lifelong punishmentMy heart goes out to Jonathan and his mother.I know what id do if I were the dead kids parents. Time to lock and load, find these idiots and dump a few pounds of lead into them.Call or email, put pressure on this D.A. for this nonsense, let your voice be heard.

Scum subhuman scumI hope she goes all John WickYour justice system is garbageI read this headline COMPLETELY wrongthe sheer amount of reliance on prosecutorial plea bargaining, pretty much only for judicial economy, is fucking shameful at best and downright functionally unconstitutional at worst.The powers that be do this so the public understands who is really in chargeLooks like mom has about 4 years to plan her revengeShe should take the law into her own hands.\u201ccommunity\u201dCompletely absurd and I can guarantee at least 2 of the 4 will be locked up again after they get out.Surprised the judge didn\u2019t reject the plea based on the DA not contacting the family first.Shoot all them bitches, then dig em up and shoot em againThese four mouth breathers are well on their way to being career criminals.  It'll catch up with all of them.Seriously said it would be a tragedy to charge the psychopath who bragged about beating someone to death with murderSorry to say but I\u2019d go John Wick on their azzes!!!!!When they get out time for a trip to the desert.And when they get out if a family member deservingly so murders these low life pieces of shit then they\u2019d get sentenced to more time smh this country is backwardsI don\u2019t know how the parents could even compose themselves. As a parent. I would dedicate my life differently after that.Oh, we used to handle things like this the proper wayBeing beaten to death is such a horrible way to die. Inhuman. These guys are going to be repeat offenders if they\u2019re given a short sentence.This is disgusting, DA needs a to be taken to the woodshed. As long as you do ALOT of really bad stuff you can plea down to a slap on the wrist is what I'm learning about our justice system.Rich kids who got away with murder... Shocker. If that's not a recipe for disaster then I dunno what is.Absolutely insane. And if the parents took it in their own hands they would be viewed as bad guysI hope Karma pays those young men a visit real soon. Don\u2019t worry, by the looks of them, they\u2019ll be a burden to the judicial system for a long time.Can they be charged federally? Maybe a hate crime......That prosecutor got a bribe or is absolutely incompetent.  If you are local to this, shame on you.They should be sent to break rocks for the rest of their miserable lives.Execute them.https://chng.it/pFPfZgf2Xd\n\nSign the petitionJust by the looks of them and based of their level of violence, they all will end up back in prison anyway.

They took my boy and by extension ruined my life. I create my own justice. And Im not even a father!DA\u2019s yet again making the world a worse placeNot convicting these fuckers of murder IS the second tragedy.

But they are getting away with 'murder', and I blame the officials.\"$$Hall of Famer Rick Barry on today's NBA: \"The athletes of today are incredible, and what they can do is incredible. But they are getting away with 'murder', and I blame the officials.\"\nIt\u2019s not the officials fault, it\u2019s whoever is telling them how to call the game.No, blame the NBA higher-ups. They're the one who dictate everything. They decide on the rules, not officials. The officials just do what they're told. \n\nThe officials are just the scapegoat here.I like to watch Rico Hines private runs at .25x speed and literally every possession has someone carrying the ball and traveling. I'm not talking about gather step, I'm talking about players shuffling their feet before they even put the ball downIsn't this an old clip?He has a point, NBA should change the rules and call them consistently, rather than \"reinterpret\" the rules or stop enforcing them. They changed the travel rule to match what was being called and no plague or swarms of locusts materialized.I\u2019ll die on the hill the James Harden step back should have been nipped in the bud immediately.In my personal utopia, the NBA would be called likes these Paris Olymipcs were.  That was some awesome-to-watch basketball.  No foul merchants.  Few ball stoppages.  Lots of flow and just really well-played basketball.  \n\nDudes were playing to score, not playing to get fouled, and I loved it! Nobody is more egregious with moving screens than GSW was from 2015-current.After watching Fiba I have to agree. Fiba is such a far superior product than the nba. \n\nHowever, outside of the olympics they don\u2019t have money to bring in the worlds best talent.Is he cookingI'd like to see what modern NBA players look like playing with the original travel/carrying rules enforced. The sheer skill and athleticism with the natural stiffness that comes when your hand can only touch the top of the ball. lolHe's 100% right.  The players can and would 100% adjust and the stars would still be stars. You perhaps don't have to be AS rigid as the 70s or something but it's gotten so out of hand.Rick Barry is GOAT grumpy old man\nhttps://youtu.be/HSFWSzEwtEgSurprised he didn\u2019t even mention foul baitingThis is where 85% of today\u2019s \u201cskill\u201d comes from.\n\nIf you called the game how it\u2019s supposed to be called, all the \u201cbag\u201d you think these players have would completely disappear.That escape drbble+1 stepback 3 needs to go. Haliburton does it all the time tooJJ in shamblesThis is all bc of Adam silver and his greed . I agree w Rick. Adam directs the refs. Offense sells.I wonder what it\u2019d be like if there were former player refs? Think a lot of older guys would call players out for stuff like this. They\u2019d also perhaps be less sensitive in terms of handing out techs, can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d t up a guy for clapping lolHe's spitting! No lies, that's what made the Olympics great imho.The NBA in my opinion has the most randomness introduced by the officials than any of the major leagues. Baseball is probably second.\n\nThere's just so many things in the NBA that relies on the judgement of the officials.This sub is contractually obligated to show this video once every few months.NBA is a shitty product. Great players, but the viewer experience is hogshit. Games are too long, tons of commercials that distract and take away, blatant rule breaking, endlessly whiny players, and more. I'll happily watch FIBA or Olympic ball anytime, but the NBA is relegated to some playoff hoops or 10 minute game recaps if anything.The NBA has several problems of which a significant part is the way the games are called. The league has gone too far away from a legitimate sports league and has now become more \u201centertainment\u201d driven, except at least in my mind nothing is less entertaining than watching some player barreling into the paint and throwing up a clumsy ass shot attempting to get a whistle. The only other shot is what used to be called an ill-advised 3. Every offense looks the same and for the most part defense doesn\u2019t matter.\n \n \n\nAdd to that pointless gimmicks like the coaches challenge, the play-in tournament and in season tournament and the overall product just becomes really unappealing.They should focus on when it truly creates a big advantage.  Faking a pull-up by putting your hand underneath the ball, then blowing by the defender needs to be called.  I do not understand why they virtually gave up on moving screens.  Having said that, a lot of the \"travels\" fans object to are from not understanding the gather step, implying that you count steps from the last time the ball hit the floor, which is simply not the rule, at least not currently.All of this is accurate.\n\nThe NBA has been systematically changing rules (and more importantly rule enforcement) to make the game *easier* to play for the human beings who are the best in the world at playing it.\n\nThe worst part is how it trickles down to the lower leagues and kids get all confused when they are whistled for a travel or a carrying violation that the NBA players routinely get away with in games. It's gotten so bad a lot of local officials have given up calling traveling violations that used to be regularly enforced a decade ago because they are so prevalent it'll bog down the game with whistles almost every possession.This is what I\u2019ve been saying years ago.\n\nAlso not calling stuff at the end of the game is bullshit. If you started calling fouls at the end of the game players would adjust and we\u2019d see a better product at the end of gamesThis is the most agreeable I\u2019ve ever seen RickHe\u2019s not wrong. The carrying is ridiculous. No one seems to know what a charge or a block is either.The carry should be enforced a little bit more, mostly on truly excessive plays. Moving offensive screens are awful, widespread, unfair, and easy to spot/call. I wouldn\u2019t mind a lot more of those called to start the season to send a message.So trueHe's not wrong. This is why the Lebron vs. MJ debate is so dumb. Put Lebron in the 90's and he's a baby back bitch. He can't play to contact. But put MJ in this generation and he scores 85 PPG. \n\nbut like has been stated, it's the NBA, not the officials. They didn't go rogue and just stop calling stuff.Everyone saying today\u2019s players are more skilled\u2026.ummm, the game is easier when you travel and carry the ball.   And today\u2019s rules don\u2019t allowed hand checking or landing u see the jump shooter.    Basketball is much easier today than it was in the past for the offensive player.  And today\u2019s player never play a full season, and never play with any kind of nagging injury\u2026 of course they look more skilled.   But they\u2019re notThose are KD saving the ball Out of  Bounds, Jayson Tatum clearly hits the hand of LBJ, James Harden maximizing the flop, and a lot more to mention but these are the memorable onesI do not mind the game as it is called now..but actually change the rules to reflect how the game is called.   It\u2019s gives the refs wayyy to much latitude to all of a sudden remember what the rules are in critical momentsAbsolutely agree. The players play what's in front of them. If anyone one saw what happened last season when the refs tightened up the whistle, the players also went with the flow.[removed]He's not wrong other than blaming the officials instead of the leagueThey wanted more entertainment in sports. I want more sports in sports.I agree, I don't even know what a travel is anymore. Everyone gets 5 stepsHavent watched the nba in yrs due to exactly what he talks aboutIt\u2019s why basketball sucks to watch now.Yea no one follows the rules in the nbaTALK TO EM RICK!!! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcafYe that\u2019s why people get confused when announcers say shit like \u201c____ is a rookie and won\u2019t get that call, but ____ is a vet so he will get the call\u201d. What a jokeRick Barry - Notorious asshole but he\u2019s absolutely right hereThe NBA has slowly gotten more unwatchable since the officiating changed in 2015. Every year it just gets worse. The refs always promise a crackdown and we get a week or two of decent basketball before it all starts again.Facts.He\u2019s not wrong.What version of the games do yall claim to want? Because I promise it\u2019s not the one where every violation is called and if your hand isn\u2019t directly over the ball it\u2019s a carry.Rick Barry is the textbook guy for \"You're not wrong, you're just an asshole\"If the WNBA does something better than NBA, it's that they have the balls to suspend their bad refs, accountability for the poor reffingthis guy would have had a seizure watching gsw a few years agoHe was right then and he's right now.He\u2019s so NOT wrong.Luka and harden downvotted this.i like watching dribble experts on instagram. i think a lot more leniency is to be expected under the current rules.Haven\u2019t checked the comments yet, but let me predict them:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right! FIBA bball is pure!\u201d\n\n\u201cHarden bad!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cI want them to dribble like Bob Cousy!\u201d\n\nRick Barry is a classic hater. Always has been. Hell of a player, though.This should be played 1000 times before every game right in front of the referees, maybe then they will get it.Blame the VegasThis clip was posted about a year ago. The reaction then is much the same way now.The amount of moving screens that aren\u2019t called in today\u2019s NBA is truly disgusting.Its not the refs fault! The rules committee makes the rules. The refs simply enforce them! While I agree the game is getting too sloppy, the owners are to blame. Let's start calling travels and get back to basics.Having to watch Joel Emfraud shot 10 FTS in just the first quarter would have Rick Barry go Bidone \ud83d\ude34 like any normal person\u00a0Respects to D. Ayton for non moving screens.I would love to see what the modern NBA would look like with strict by the book officiating, I don't know about permanently but definitely for an exhibitionThis MFer is \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf SPITTING TRUTH.Speak on it Rick Berry. The commissioner is directly responsible too. Rick Berry was averaging 30 as a one man band in GS he knows the gameI wonder how much he actually believes this, because hes been making the exact same claim since shortly after he retired. Maybe he does maybe he doesn't idk.adjusting to market valuesThey always have.  The bigger the name the more you can get away with.It kinda looks like they tuck the ball in and take 4 steps to the basket like a running back. I mean aesthetically it looks nice but I guess I\u2019m getting too old to understand the rules as a casual watcher.I think there is something to what he is saying here - it is like monopoly, people add free parking and collect 400 if you land on go and all other sorts of house rules to make the game \u201ckinder\u201d and \u201cmore fun\u201d but in the end it makes the game way longer, and people get more upset.NBA, NFL, NHL, MLB are all sports entertainment.   It's no different than WWE/AEW, at the end of the day its a business here to entertain you and to put money in their coffers.i think even he knows it\u2019s not just the refs. he probably just doesn\u2019t want to say it\u2019s the higher ups (adam silver, and whoever else cares about the viewership) he just doesn\u2019t want all that smokeYes, I'm old. Call me whatever you like. But I have thought the lack of traveling calls in the NBA to be bullshit for thirty years. It's a fundamental rule of the sport and I don't know why we call it when you are thirteen but stop calling it at the highest level.Oh my god.  I\u2019d so love to watch pro NBA again for this very reasonTravel rules are absurd. They are doing sh-- that I would have laughed at someone for trying in middle school like long jumping one step at a time in slow motion.Thissssss. Majority of the time I see a sweet crossover, I go back to the replay and see a blatant carry first which ruins it for me. It\u2019s not even being disguised because it\u2019s not being calledI despise the loose-rules too.  I always hated playing against these players that double-dribble and travel on every possession.  \n\nWhen a player is dribbling, they can go anywhere on the court, so you have to defend everywhere.  But, the second they pick the ball up, they can only go 1.5 steps.  That's actually a pretty small area - just a cone in front of them that extends maybe 15 feet.  That's a pretty small area to defend.\n\nSo, the second a player picks up the ball - you immediately close in on him.  He has nowhere to go (outside of those 1.5 steps).\n\nYet, in the NBA, they are allowed to double-dribble with impunity - so the defender jumps up, expecting the offensive player to only have a few options - then the guy double-dribbles and his options open up again.  It's infuriating.  They aren't beating you because they are good, they are beating you because they are cheating.\n\nIt's the same thing with travels.  As soon as the guy stops dribbling, he only has 1.5 steps - so you immediately start defending that 1.5 steps.  So, he just takes 2.5 steps instead and scores.\n\nThey call it this way, because higher-scoring is more exciting to watch than better-defense.  But, it's still cheating...I\u2019m 36 and totally agree. Don\u2019t blame players for finding an edge. It is literally what you pay them to do.Call offensive fouls too. Embiid has made a career off of committing uncalled offensive fouls and somehow getting free throws for themThe officials are the scape goats here I guess he didn\u2019t want to criticize the nba directlyThey are obsessed with seeing records get broken because record breakers sell tickets. Easy to increase scoring records by increasing how easy it is to score. I stopped watching NBA a few years ago. \"EuRo-StEp MoVeS\"?!!?!? no, it's fucking travelling. Ridiculous how carrying is part of the game now, the fact that travelling is not only not called but codified and given a special name for the move.\n\nWe should be rewarding the players that can move the ball, not watering down the skill level to let skilled players be made obsolete. It's legit just a size league now. Not to mention how mobbed up the game is. They get advertising money from online bookies for chrissakes.i agree.  and the NBA is horrible to watch because of it.Honestly, I think it's also legit extra hard to officiate these athletes. I sometimes think I've seen an extra step or travel, but I can't confirm without replay.The carrying is crazy. Can't watch guys like LaMelo at all. I've always like Kyrie though for being so precise with footwork and dribble.[](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud)Idk about you but I watch just for the moving screensThey need to rewrite the travel rule for today's players, just awful to watchI think the question casual NBA fans have to ask themselves is \n\n\u201cDo you want less scoring, more, or keep it where it\u2019s at now?\u201d\n\nPeople point to the viewership going down in recent years, but last I checked that won\u2019t really have an effect on the NBA as a business until they renegotiate TV deals in a decade\u2026the last few times they\u2019ve renegotiated the overall money has gone up by magnitudes \n\nEventually I see this style of basketball hurting the business side of things for the NBA but not by much\u2026people still tune in enough for these multinational media conglomerates to offer the NBA billions of dollars per year \n\nThe overall valuation of teams has skyrocketed as well, and I haven\u2019t even mentioned the next major change we might see come to professional sports and the NBA\u2026venture capital and investment funds buying in\n\nI can see the NBA taking a page from the Premier League and allowing some foreign investment in to help bolster the league and it\u2019s teams\n\nImagine the Saudis throwing a few billion or more into the League and creating an off shoot or tournament there\u2026\n\nThis is all to say that the casual fan is how we got here today, with the NBA putting out a watered down game and product the past decadeI agree w the traveling\u2026 that is out of control.It\u2019s so true what he is saying. Sadly, we won\u2019t see it. What real fans want is to see competition at the highest level that is officiated at the highest level. The NBA is a commercial commodity that will endorse sensationalism and celebrity over sport. But I really hope that the NBA learns what real fans want.i do agree. i see traveling every game i watch and i remember for me it felt weird to travel like i knew i traveled so it was breaking the rules so subconciously couldnt do it but some of these guys excel at getting away with traveling and thats why their paid the big bucksRick is rightThis voice - man this voice is amazing \ud83e\udd29 \nI want to hear documentaries narrated by him. I want my life narrated by him.NBA is the only sport where the old and new era constantly complain about each other.Its called skill, not murder.Welp. Full disclosure, older NBA fan here, and I agree with these statements. It you\u2019re the most casual of fans it doesn\u2019t matter. You probably don\u2019t know what it means to travel or carry. \n\nHowever, the NBA has something very valuable in common with soccer. All you need is a ball, two people, and not a whole lot of space to play the game in its essence. That means that you\u2019ve ever had a passion for the game and played it any level, including just on a nerf hoop, there\u2019s a chance you have some understanding of the rules and played by them. \n\nFor some people watching today\u2019s game, that means seeing players constantly get away with breaking the fundamental rules of the game. Rules that you would call against them if you happened to be playing against them. This is not a catastrophic problem for the NBA by any means but I do think it\u2019s worth considering if they lose than they gain from an entertainment aspect by calling the game so loosely. \n\nMe personally, I can\u2019t just not see it. And I do experience a tiny bit of outrage at all the obvious travels and carries that don\u2019t get called. If it were just a few, no big deal, refs are human. But it seems the NBA just doesn\u2019t care at all about these violations.Steve Kerr is gonna send Dray after this man and we will see if he actually gets away with murder off the court. No codes or lines will be broken or crossed.He's cookingBro looks a lot like Lance Armstrong it\u2019s kind of a tripDid buddy watch the Olympics? The rules aren\u2019t THAT different in the nba compared to the whole world. We\u2019ve all moved on old man.Just another old guy mad that he didn\u2019t get paid half of what the worst player in the league is making now.It's great to hear Rick Barry's perspective. The evolution of the game and the skill level of today's athletes are truly impressive!He's not wrongprofessional basketball is the only sport I've ever watched where the pro version of the game is easier to play than the college version.  They get more fouls.  They don't call moving screens.  They can travel.  A player can hip check a defender out of his position (this is getting much worse in college though, to be fair) and drive past.  It's overwhelmingly favored to the offense.\u201cGetting away with murder\u201d is no talent bums in the 80\u2019s, 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s who couldn\u2019t do anything but play \u201cphysical defense\u201d and muck up the game, no dribbling no shooting and can\u2019t make free throws but they\u2019re in the game to beat the hell out of a guy who can \n\nCurry would be getting beat up and stepped under playing in 2001 and the game is better off now that some guy who has no talent can\u2019t be on the court specially just to be \u201cphysical\u201d with himPreach.100 percent agree.  Enough with the carrying and traveling on nearly every play, endless moving screens, and most especially start ejecting players for flopping.Oh, I thought he was talking about off-the-court legal problems like spouse abuse and sexual assault.I may be in the minority but I think most calls aren't travels. Even older NBA games have instances of the gather step.\n\nBut I definitely agree with carrying. Every \"hesi\" is such a BS move these days because the hand is literally under the ball. The carrying plane is supposed to be around that 90 degree line (from 6 o'clock to 3/9 o'clock), but it's basically just 0 degrees these days. I think \\~30-45 degrees is acceptable if it's a fluid movement but these guys have such huge hands so they can basically \"get away with murder\" in that sense.They should rename the league to the NDA - No Defense Allowed. Seriously, with the carries, travels and step back threes where they can literally run into the next suburb to create space for themselves, these guys would be lost if you somehow found a time machine and transported them into a past era. They'd get whistled off the court....though I'm sure they would quickly adapt to those rules it would definitely seem like a harder game to them....and that's not even talking about defenses actually being allowed to try and stop offensive players. How much their 'superior' athleticism and skills would overcome all that is pure subjecture.Oh my fucking god this is actually being posted every off season isn\u2019t  it? And people are acting like it\u2019s something recent and kept adding the same commentary. Can\u2019t wait until OctoberIt's okay Rick you can say \"Giannis\"He is just repeating what a lot of older people think about today\u2019s basketball. When I would listen to country music growing up my dad would say \u201cthat\u2019s not country music\u201d. Now I hear today\u2019s country music and think the same thing lol. He is even older and played it, so I can understand why he feels so strongly about today\u2019s ball. That being said, he definitely is a grumpy old man.Rick is absolutely right.\n\nJust the wrong guy to say it imo.\n\n(Cause he\u2019s an asshole)Old man yells at cloudnever seen this old fart happyYep NBA sucks, stopped watching \\~2015 and whenever I watch it's just sad to see how shit the game is compared to something like euroleague.Damn Rick Barry is angrier than I thought he would be.Bruh he's made the same rant 5 times nowA huge part that is\u2026 it is just discourse for NBA.  \n\nPeople complained about Wilt getting away with murders back in the days.  Then MJ.  Then Shaq. \n\nThere are always going to be a very loud community that complains, but before social media, their voices weren\u2019t heard as much, and now is amplified 1000x.\n\nThe product itself has been undoubtedly better.Old man yells at clouds.Could they use AI to call? It really is ridiculous.Haven't we all yet realized that the NBA is basically the WWE with a ball? Dramatic storylines (free agency), heels (Durant), mouthy managers (players' dads)?\u201cI didn\u2019t watch the second half of the season\u201d is what I heardTrying to grow my new community.

That last bit sounds cold, but go listen to some true crime and you'll see how true it is.  It's very sad.  Resources simply aren't allocated to investigate the deaths of those on the margins of society.  Especially if there's even a remote possibility that it was suicide or an overdose.As a Nurse with people actively on hospice.\u00a0 \u00a0This would be incredibly easy.\u00a0\u00a0Working in healthcare gives me access to numerous ways to kill someone that would be undetectable. I would likely go with insulin overdose. Completely undetectable and relatively easy to get your hands on. Another option would be a potassium overdose  which would be slightly trickier to acquire but just as effective.\n\nI am almost certain I could get away with murder. Purely hypothetically speaking of course :)\n\nEDIT: I have learned about C-peptide testing and revise my answer to state that I would use insulin on someone who wouldn\u2019t have an autopsy. Would have to set the scene to either make it look natural or like an accidentDude wants that inheritance earlyNot capable but i know if i wear a mask and gloves and sprinkle some fentanyl on a sleeping homeless person im getting away with it.I feel like anyone who lives anywhere with a large population of homeless people could get away with murder. Hell a city not too far from me had a guy killing homeless people who only got caught because he kept doing it.I guess there's two options.\n\nFly to a third world country. Fairly sure for enough money you'll be able to buy a human to do whatever you want with. Kill them and head home to collect your $100,000,000.\n\nOr\n\nVolunteer at a hospital cancer ward. Find someone who's terminal & in pain. Inject a large enough bubble into their IV or find them another way to help end their suffering. Collect your $100,000,000I\u2019d choose someone who is completely unconnected to me.  Would probably poison them as it would be easier to get away with.  They would have to be some type of criminal that causes harm to people.I would probably spend a while finding someone who was worthy of actually being killed and then decide in the moment. \n\n  \nMaybe find a child trafficker in the act or something? Anything where my conscious can be 100% clear. \n\n  \nFeels like something that would help humanity, my conscious can be clear, and if it's done right there is a low chance of getting caught killing someone you don't know. Especially if you can travel the world.Itd be pretty easy right? You just get a random (bad) person and shoot them. No ties, nothing that would realistically make you a target of investigation. No chance of you getting caughtEasy. Go to some third world country on holiday, murder some homeless person at night while being masked up and then fly home.I do not know that I am capable of murder, as far as taking someone's life. I don't think I could do that, even for $100 million.\n\nBut getting away with it? That isn't all that hard these days, in busier big cities a murder gets about 24 hours of investigation before they solve it, establish something to go on or move on.\n\nSo straw purchase a .38 revolver, deface it so no serial numbers on it, and load hollow point ammunition while wearing gloves. Then you buy a car dirt cheap, as there are people who sell cars for cash.\n\nShoot someone random at night in a secluded place and walk away. Drop the gun on the ground or throw it in a river, put the clothing in a trash bag before you get into your new cheap car, then abandon the car and take a bus home, washing the clothing in some serious industrial grade cleaner.\n\nThat is a cold case right there, if you never tell anyone about it, you never get caught, but people tend to tell someone. And I wouldn't have it in me to do it anyway.I'd probably kill someone o on the deathbed. He is in hospital , terminally ill cancer. I tell him if he lets me kill him i will give his family some money. Win win.[ Removed by Reddit ]Now, I am not saying that I would do it. But. \n\nYou go to mostly northern city. I'm thinking Montreal. We have a pretty big homeless crisis right now. \n\nI find an honeless person in winter, and offer them booze. Strong one, and a lot of it. This is not illegal. \n\nI keep giving it to them, and insist that they stay outside with me in frigid weather. I wait until they pass out/fall asleep, and just.... walk away. \n\nThey will most likely die of exposure. Even if the police found me, then what? I gave them booze? Unless someone else was with us or if there was directly a camera pointing at us, I could just say that I gave them booze and walked away. That they were conscious and told me that they would go to a shelter before a left. \n\nI would get away with it.You guys are getting paid?Thats so easy lol free 100 million, just kill a drug addict by giving them bad drugs in a random city while you are travelling through, there's no way anyone would be able to track that down and tbh they probably would just drop the casei can neither confirm nor deny if i am capable or how i will do it.\u00a0The money is for the guilt you\u2019ve got to live with, not the ease of doing itI\u2019d accept. Both of my parents have expressed that they would prefer to die early than live bedridden with little cognition.

Find a campground in their general vicinity, drive down, camp a couple nights with the family, take care of business, stay another night or two, head home.\n\nIf you're at a loss for a target, there's always the sex offender registry. It will helpfully tell you things like the severity and type of the crime. You have to figure that every one of them has people who have more motive than you do.Having been homeless for a few months in my youth this thread makes me uncomfortable.

And murders where theirs no suspect are almost never solved. So this is basically an ethical questionI feel like I could very easily get away with it. Case solving rates by police are relatively low, especially when it comes to certain groups. The main issue is that I don't have it in me to murder a person. I value human life more than money and I also don't think any amount of money would be able to unfuck me mentally after that.Literally just go on vacation to Brazil, drive-by some random homeless man, 100M and you'll literally never even be searched forSomething like 43% if all murders go unsolved.

Give me the cash.I live in Alaska and operate heavy equipment. I'd just dig a 20ft deep hole and backfill it when I'm done.People get away with murder all the time. The question should really be simply whether it not you're willing to take someone's life for $100 mill. Judging from past posts here, the majority here would do it for a significantly smaller payout.1) Go to Canada.   \n\n2) Find a First Nations woman. \n\n3) Take her out to a deserted stretch of highway. \n\n4) Kill her and dump the body. \n\n5) Go back to America. \n\nThe police don't even investigate the murder of First Nations women in Canada, so I'm 100% gonna get away with it.firstly id have to choose a target. it would be someone unrelated to me in every way, and they would have to frequent an area with a low amount of people and cameras. most likely a drug dealer since there would be a significant amount of suspects that wouldn\u2019t include me. i\u2019d use either a brick or a hammer. pros of a brick is i wouldnt really have to buy it id just find it in a random place. after i\u2019ve killed them id walk for a couple of miles and then dispose of the brick. i\u2019d smash the brick into little pieces until its powder, then pour the powder into a river. i\u2019d then burn the clothes i wore with petrol and id make sure that id stand far away when i start the fire as to not get any residue on my body. this way there is no clear motive, eyewitness or surveillance, no forensic evidence linking me to it and nothing placing me at that place at that time. id just leave the body there as it would be much more difficult to dispose of a body due to the risk of someone or a camera spotting me and getting their blood+dna on myself. id also make sure im wearing gloves and something to cover my hair and face.I am absolutely capable of abusing the letter of the law. Find a person about to commit suicide over a lack of money. Tell them I\u2019ll give them 10mil if they let me kill them and resurrect them. Do it over international waters, kill them with a heart attack I cause and revive them with defibrillators. Problem solved, now they have 10mil and I have 45x more than I would probably see in my lifetimeI have spent way too much time in this comment sectionBro easy I'll just become a copI choose Maggie SmithPretty easy to find someone with a terminal illness who wants to die.Couldn\u2019t do it. But the easiest way to get away with it would be to pick an target that would stay relatively publicity free and has no connection to you - so no known criminal or young person, homeless would probably do it. Establish a routine so you being there isn\u2019t abnormal. Poison would be simplest, but even a quick knife to the kidneys would do it. Just keep on walking. Act natural. Dispose of the evidence a distance from the scene or your home. Say nothing.yesYea I know I could do it, and get away with it.It\u2019s pretty easy to murder someone and get away with it. Just kill a random who you have zero attachment and interactions with, choose a weapon that can be obliterated like wood and do it in a place with little witnesses around and no cameras. But you can always dress up in dark clothing and do it at night. \n\nI\u2019m able to do all that sure but I don\u2019t think I could morally just kill some one random regardless of the money involved.they don't call me patrick bateman for nothingYeah, this would be easy. I know too many people with peanut allergies.I wonder how many people here use the excuse of \u201cworthy evil person\u201d as a moral justification to kill, or like an excuse to kill in general with moral impunity. \n\nSure, there are those who have the intention to make the world a better place, but I would not be surprised if some just wanted the excuse  to kill with social/moral impunity.I'd work towards getting a job as the person who euthanizes people who choose soDo I get some of the money advance to I\u2019m funded for planning and carrying it out?Yes, I could.So, what I just become an anti-choice protestor? Become the ceo of a multi-national that's a heavy polluter? join a group protesting 2SLGBTQIA rights? become a member of the NRA? these folks do it for much less than 100M...Uncontacted tribe in the Amazon and a sniper rifle.I can do this and keep it moral.\u00a0\n\n\nI find someone terminal that the hospital won't assist in dying with dignity, and I assist.\n\n\nIt's classified as murder, but both them and I see it as a mercy.\u00a0Take a trip to a warzone. There are so many dying that one more wouldn't take much notice and is likely to be tallied as another casualty and no further investigation into itPick someone completely random probably a homeless guy in a different town than what I live in. Use false plates, wear gloves. Feed them to the gators in our local park (no cameras and people do NOT go there).set up the guys tent and supplies near the gator area so it looks like an accident.  Deep clean the car, add a few bumper stickers, change the plates.  then just live life as normal.I already have a list started. Do I get more money for more murders? /sNice try FBI.i'd just buy shares of an oil company and become complicit in murder by proxyIn 2022 in the US at least.  50% of all murders go unsolved.  That's out of the autopsy's that the coroner suspects foul play.  Which they are good but not 100%.  The first, and biggest thing investigators do is look for people that might have a cause to do so (if there's not something direct like a bullet they can trace).  \n\nSo if you choose a random person, poison them with something that's fairly common then your odds are pretty much guaranteed you'll get away with it.\n\nNow as far as morality goes.  Id take my time doing research and euthanize an older person with no family and possibly a terminal diagnosis.  Idk if you have seen a very late stage old person but it gets to a point that they want to go.  My great grandma would be disappointed when she woke up and saw a living family member because she knew she was still alive and didn't die in her sleep.I wouldn't do this I think.\n\nBut I reckon the easiest way to do this would be to go to a country like India where theres a minority class and lackluster police energy. Kill a woman with dark skin, stage it as a hanging suicide, and the police will just settle for that without really trying to prove otherwise. \n\nThis idea comes from a post I saw yesterday on r/examinedeath where this litterally happened (crowd protest got the police to actually investigate). \n\n\nAnother idea would be to join an army currently much stronger than its targets. Cant join Ukraine or Russia since I could die so it would have to be Israel. Just shoot some brown children and boom: praise from western media, a shiny medal and a neat 100M. \nOf course, the difficulty here is joining the army of a country you don't belong to. Also, I'm a black athiest so I might end up committing suicide by shooting myself in the back of the head twice.its sad to think about but homeless drug addicts would be the easiest target. Find a way to purposely OD them or pay another druggie to do something to the first person and you'll easily walk away scot-freeVenmo me the funds, already completed the task. Miss you mom.sadly its too easy to do this in a 3rd world country, especially if you can just fly back. On top of that the money would give you the means to fight it in court and win.Done.  Where is my $100m?Oh thats easy. Killing a stranger is the easiest thing to get away with. Most murders are solved because thr suspect is obvious, or the motive is trackable (robbery)Probably couldn't go through with it even after I think of the most fool proof way of getting away with it.People need killing. Mr. And Mrs. SmithGo into some homeless shack at 2am in some secluded park and pop 3 rounds into the hobo's back. Walk away afterwards.\n\nThose things never get investigated, the body could decompose for months before anyone finds it. By which point it'd be pointless to make an investigation. No cameras, no witnesses, easy moneyI mean\u2026..the state used perjury to indict me for a felony crime that I was a victim of\u2026..they refuse to prosecute the criminal after I solved the case for fear of damaging the DA\u2019s reputation. I could cause harm to the criminal and never be prosecuted. Worth the risk for $100 million.Abandoned baby is probably the safest route I would think. Smother it and they'll just look for the mother.A logging and processing site.   Why organized crime doesn't own more of them baffles me....No i dont wanna kill anybodyWould be able to hire an accomplice?\nI understand Id still be the one to go down if caught, but does it count if the murder is done by my order instead of strictly by my hands?Besides the homeless theory, I'm sure if you went to an already high murder area like Southside Chicago you could get in, get out, and police might not even investigate. They'd just chalk it up to 'normal gang or drug activity' and not give a fuckDoes it count if I enlist in the Ukrainian Army and go kill some Russians?Stab up a nonce in a 3rd world country, nobody would care and it won\u2019t even be investigated\u2026 easy 100mThe sex offender registry is public, denotes a risk level, and details the type of offence & victim age. \n\nI'll take that $100m with a plenty clean enough conscience.Pay for an abortion since its considered murder to many folks.Does this scale? Can I get $200m for 2 and so on?You could make it an even ten murders AAANNNNDDDD I'm all over it boss!!\nWith all the illegal rapists and pedos this TRASH administration has let in this country.. Victims everywhere lolHard no.Become a police officer and shoot a black teen with a memorable name.Is it $100 million *per murder*? I could do this easily. Just >!Nice try, Fed. What, ya think I'm stupid or something?!<Go to North Sentinel Island, fly a drone over their village and secretly drop a couple of used tissues I had with a cold.\u00a0\n\n\nI'd get in legal trouble sure, but not for murder.Travel far from home for a hunting trip, bonus points if I can actually get a tag for the trip and fill it with whatever animal I\u2019m hunting. Long range shot on someone that society won\u2019t miss (many true crime docs/pods have discussed how victims like homeless/prostitutes aren\u2019t given the same level of investigation because they aren\u2019t \u201cmissed\u201d). \n\nTaking the shot from range with a bolt action rifle means no shell casing left, no evidence around the body, and then I\u2019m not even in the same state a week later with no one questioning why I traveled out of state with a rifle because I\u2019ve got a cooler full of deer meat. \n\nOr hell, something like 50% of murders go unsolved, probably wouldn\u2019t even need to go to the extremes I mentioned for better than a coin flip oddsDoes abortion count? /sEasyThis is too easy.  I don't think people realize how easy it is to get away with murder.  If you pick a random person in a random part of the world and never go back you'll very likely get away with it doing nothing.  Actively trying to get away with it and your odds go up to basically a guarantee.  Murders get solved because there are connections to those murdered.  Random killings are the most difficult to solve and are almost universally unsolved.is it only one murder or can it be multiple?You looking for ideas OP?Getting away with murder isn\u2019t actually difficult, the vast majority of murders do not result in anyone being convicted, particularly if the killer lacks a direct personal connection.  If you kill your spouse, decent chance you get caught, if you kill someone you don\u2019t know, damn near zero chance you get caught if you take some very basic precautions.\n\nSo then the question becomes, who are you willing to kill for money?  There are some obvious candidates for me, but the easiest option is probably a sex offender.  There\u2019s a literal database of them with names and addresses, and police generally hate them so it\u2019s unlikely to be a thorough investigation.I'll offer myself as tribute, IF we get to split the money... Wait...Would murdering some uncontacted tribe with my modern sicknesses count?Just kill some random guy across the world you have nothing to do with, wear a ski mask and put on a few layers of gloves100m to take a bunch of crows on a trip, sounds greatYes, officer, this thread right here.And here the military is doing it for freeThis would be so easy to do with all the homeless people around.Take a plane ticket to any backwards country with no extradition treaty ,off some beggar at night  and take a plane back the next morning.\n\n\nBuy yourself a new conscience \nEasy peasyYesh nahNice Try FBI guyHow long do you have to \u2018get away with it\u2019s before you\u2019re awarded the money? I get that you could be arrested, charged and convinced many years down the line and lose everything, but do you get the money as soon as the deed is done? It\u2019s just taken away as soon as you get arrested?Middle of the night, rural town a few states over, pay cash for a beater on Craigslist, remove no plates, roll the window down and drop the guy in the crosswalk, continue your drive, drop the gun in pieces in other states a few borders over, enjoy your vacation, fly home. \n\nYou have no connection to the victim in the slightest. The murder weapon would never be connected due to a lack of reasonable suspicion. There's nowhere for the local PD to even start their investigation.Does it count if you aren't charged with murder, but something else? \n\nThe simplest way to kill someone and get away without serious penalties is to get into a car accident.Done. No where is my moneyDisguise, hand out fent to homeless people. Ones bound to drop.An absolute ton of inner city crime goes unsolved so yeah, I think I could get away with it. Now am I capable of doing it? For that price tag, probably.This would be so easy. Who\u2019s gonna ask about some random homeless dude ya know? There\u2019s so many easy options if you\u2019re willing to do the killing part. And who wouldn\u2019t be? You\u2019d be doing everyone a service if you cleaned a homeless person off the street. Win winStupid hypothetical\u2026 I\u2019d let you pick the target for much much lessA lot of how people get caught is doing it again or having a connection to the victim. So the whole bet thing sort of is a good starting point.Remove the guilt from the equation and I think it would be quite easy for anyone with an average IQ to kill a random person and get away. The only way I would do it is if I could locate a person that truly deserved death. Getting access to someone like would be the hard part.At first I read this as getting $100 million but being required to commit a murder but being guaranteed to get away with the murder.\n\nI was like \"Well I could do that...\"Easy peasyFind a homeless person in a depression of some kind.  Leave a large chunk of dry ice near them.  They should die of carbon dioxide suffocation.  No evidence left over.  Just need to scout for any cameras.  Wear clothes you can toss or burn.Murder count includes adults only or also children? What ever.... just sign up for IDF easy money then.This is scary easy so long as you target someone you have no connection to and take the most basic of precautions.\n\n Cover face/hands/body, don't drive all the way there (or at all if the vehicle has OnStar or similar), pick a method and location that won't lead to the body being discovered immediately, keep phone with battery out/don't take phone, only pay with cash for anything related to the deed/when traveling to/from location, don't risk a fight, don't search for equipment or how to's on any equipment or networks you own.\n\nI'd feel bad about it, but I could, and I probably would.Go to a 3rd world country, would be super easy to make a water gun that shoots poison and spray it in someones drink from far away. Could probably rack up quite a few.This would be easy. There are some very run down areas near where I live where there aren't cameras for blocks, and potential witnesses are few and far between. Just pick a random homeless person and be done with it. Their deaths aren't investigated anywhere nearly as hard as someone who is easily identified/has loved ones looking for answers, and most of their deaths get attributed to overdose, exposure to the elements, or other homeless people killing them. Since I don't have any DNA or fingerprints in any government system (or any relatives' DNA in private companies' databases like Ancestry or 23&Me), even if they were to find any DNA or fingerprints of mine, they'd have nothing to compare it to. I also know enough about forensics to know what measures to take to make sure I don't leave either behind, or any other evidence that could point back to me as the killer.\n\nAnd as soon as I get my $100m, I'm moving somewhere very far away to minimize the chances the cops ever come looking.Turn off phone location tracking.\n\nDrive to small town far away.\n\nWalk. Dark clothing.\n\nStab someone in back of neck with screwdriver.\n\nRemove outer layer, place in rucksack which was under previous layer.\n\nReturn to vehicle. Return home.\n\nBurn clothes. \n\nThoroughly clean screwdriver. Drive to another town, dump in town garbage dump.Easily, but I wouldn't tell you how.I could wipe out a couple city blocks by moving a few wires around. Any evidence would be completely destroyed, so I think I'd be able to get away with it.Unfortunately where I live there's a decent amount of homeless people and drug addicts in the area. As I have zero connection to the homeless community or the drug addict community I could easily go into one of the encampments shoot somebody and leave. With no connections they'd have no lead to come towards me to check my firearm for ballistic evidence. Honestly it's sad to say but the cops would barely investigate this murder because the homeless are seen as disposable people.Fly to a different country stab someone. Leave.Nah I wouldn\u2019t do itCurrently 142 people ending up on some kind of government watch list.just go on a hike and shoot someone in the woodsStep one find someone you are in no way connected to you nor has any way of coming back to you.\n\nStep two befriend someone who works in the cremating business or bribe them not to talk for full use of facilities.\n\nStep three go about your normal life as if nothing happened.There\u2019s someone in my town who everyone knows killed her sister in law. Police haven\u2019t arrested her because they don\u2019t have proof. But everyone knows lol. People don\u2019t get convicted for murder hereTake the easy E route.I don\u2019t have access to the only people I\u2019d consider murdering.I feel like I could do this, I've watched enough CSI and NCIS and all that other Law and Order shows.Would causing a public health incident like with what happened with the listeria outbreak from hogs head be out of the question?YesNah I'm ok.... ok a wasp.Sure, just find somewhere where assisted suicide is illegal.I know people who own a large farm with lots of animals who'd be happy to help dispose of a body. Hypothetically, of course. \ud83d\ude09This is literally the easiest ask on here so far lmao.\n\nCops are stupid and only idiots or the arrogant get caught.You guys are going about it in the completely wrong way. Stanger, not your hometown, rifle bought secondhand and melted down after use. Pick someone that society cares little about and take out a random one late at night from a long distance.Reading through this thread is eye opening. Seems like if you are a psychopath who wants to get away with murder, just get into healthcare.I would go after a homeless person. Lesser chance of someone knowing they\u2019re missing\u2026Yeah, just kill a local pedo and make the world a better place while getting rich. Not super hard to get away with, there\u2019s millions of unsolved murders in the US.Easy. Just take a Disney cruise and throw someone overboard. Nothing bad is allowed to happen at Disney so they will spend millions of dollars covering it up and making u look inocent. Dont even gotta pay to make myself look good. Disney will do it all for me. Now you must be saying why would you even think that is possible? Maybe because it has happened like 3 times already and Disney covered it up each time. They literally have a rule that you can't give them bad news about anything in meetings. You have to spin it into a positive no matter how bad it is. That attitude permiates the entire corporation. Murder is bad news. So the answer is to cover it up and say nothing bad ever happened to begin withJust become a cop, they get away with it all the time.Give a custy's fentanyl in the product. No one suspects a dope heads OD to be pre-med murder. 10/10 will shoot up whatever some random stranger gives them. Would work on base heads tooElderly parents. They could go at any time.....I\u2019ve watched enough Dateline to pull this off. Trust me broHow: Mask, hat, and a shotgun on somebody I have no contact with in an isolated place. Ensure the kill, leave immediately, destroy the gun. \n\nCould I: Probably not.Can I murder myself and then my family and friends get the money?While tempting I would decline on moral grounds. It's not that there aren't a few sorry users in my past that haven't caused me enough trouble that I would enjoy killing them but I would only kill them if they came after me.But we are all murders already. My tax money financed a murder.A dremel tool. A pane of glass. A recipe for brownies. Time. Do I get a bonus for taking out an entire HOA board?You act like this is a hypothetical questionI am not capable of murder but if I had to I would find someone with an imminently-terminal illness and offer a million to their loved ones if I can speed up the process no questions askedEasy. My bio father.\n\nNo guilt, they\u2019d have a hard time connecting it to me, and the world has one less horrible person.\n\nThe payday is just a bonus, reallyAs someone who has had a couple of motorbikes stolen and spent sleepless nights thinking about, and fantasizing of what I'd do if I'd have caught the little pricks (on camera, probably teenagers), I can adapt a plan.\n\nBuy a cheap non running motorbike, the trap bike, to be left somewhere risky where it won't last an hour after nightfall. I've considered hydraulic spikes in the saddle that go off at 50mph, explosives, furious furious bees, etc...\n\nBut for this scenario I'd go subtler. Something fantastically toxic, ideally radioactive but poisonous inhalable dust will do just as well. Because realistically the bike is getting stripped for parts, whoever is running the chop shop is getting a lethal dose as well as whichever brats take it. Like poisoning the queen of an ant colony.\n\nYes this is the most difficult part, acquiring the toxic macguffin.\n\nLet's say some days, weeks or months later I'm announced lottery winner. Happy days.\n\nMaybe there's an investigation into an exotic poisoning in the news. Gang or family definitely aren't having police investigate the chop shop. Maybe a radioactive macguffin discovered by criminals, police arrest them due to evidence of bike thefts, solve the case of the bad guys with dangerous stuff.Easy. Fly across the world, kill some random homeless person, fly back.\n\nBe careful to avoid cameras and stuff, and odds are you'll never get caught.If your conscience would let you, killing a rando and not getting caught would be simple.Whether or not I could stomach it is the real question. The actual doing of it though? Well honestly the hardest part about murder is usually the motivation, why would someone want to kill this person and who would have the means and opportunity. But if I just wanted to kill a random person, say a homeless man in their sleep, and it may take is a big rock and some gloves. Just a quick violent act, avoid cameras, don't bleed or piss or d some other random act to leave a bunch of evidence, and it becomes a simple random act of violence with no rhyme or reason, the \"perfect\" crime.I can't speak for other countries, but any American could do this over a random weekend without much issue, just a matter of if they're willing to or not.I live near Portland so it wouldn't be too hard. Go into town late at night, plug a druggie, walk away.I grew up in a funeral home.  This is light work.So you could just help euthanize a millionaire dying of cancer  per his request..? Assuming it\u2019s legally still considered murder?Get a homeless person drunk and push them in front of a trainI'd take a job as an executioner in a Texas penitentiary. I'd have my money in no time!You never specified it had to be a human. Just give me some plants and they will mysteriously die after a few weeks.I live in a 3rd world country. This ones easy.My mom\u2019s 86, in terrible health, and longing to die without any hospitals or nursing homes. no trouble. She takes twenty kinds of eye drops. I\u2019ll just put some in her coffee. Whatever kind it was that guy murdered his two wives with. They will certainly not look at the death of an 86 yo with heart trouble with suspicion\u2026 and if they did they\u2019d assume she did it herself accidentally.This is literally too easy.  Quick visit to Mexico.  Behead someone and make it look like Cartel work.  Profit.I'm murdering some poor hiker in the middle of nowhere on the Appalachian trail I guess. Body is going down some abandoned mineshaft or buried deep in the woods miles off trail. Another option is find some poor homeless vagabond train hopper and push them in front of a train and make it look like an accident. Don't think I'm capable of murder but feel like I could get away with it if it can be any random person. Taking someone out on a boat and just pushing them overboard miles offshore also an option. Just need plausible deniability. They went for a swim and drowned or fell off doing something stupid ect.I would go find a crazy homeless man with no family or friends and just stage a suicide or an accident. Nobody will go looking.People do this with their cars all the timeJesus Christ some of these replies are scary \ud83d\ude2dOk, I take a couple of crows. I have a murder of them. I start running with the birds. I disappear over a hill. I don't come back for the money.I would do in it via traffic accident. Get a big safe suv and hit someone driving like an idiot. For example: speeding like an dumbass on the highway on a motorcycle with no helmet doing a willie. The idiots on my commute would easly die if someone just tapped them. I'll get caught but totally get off with a slap on the wrist. Ez Next best plan is be a nurse at a hospice care center. Simply increase the morphine and call it a day.\u00a0Get away with it for how long?People underestimate the power of camping trips.Switch careers to be a cop. Become 'scared for my life'.

I'm either gonna take out a pedo and make a hundred mil, or the world is at least down 1 child molester. Seems like a worthy gamble.One of the san Francisco homeless fentanyl addicts\u2026poor bastards are close to death anyways.Is this retroactive?Hmm\u2026 is this actually $100MM or do you take half in taxes?I'll go work in prison and administer the injection for a death row inmate.Does sanctioned killing while in the military count?Dumb question :\n\nHow long constitutes \"getting away with it\"?\n\nSay I get my payout and Cold Case solves it 10 years later?Just become a cop or a soldier if you want to kill someone. There\u2019s nonstop opportunities for socially sanctioned killings.I'd walk onto the Senate floor and beat Ted Cruz to death with a bat. I have it on good authority that no one present would be able to recall who did it.Would I be able to do it, probably not because I wouldn't kill a person, but here is the boring answer on how to get away with it:\n\nAsshole answer: kill a homeless person during the night, police will not put many resources into finding out who was the killer. The place would be any big city with a lot of homeless people and violence, so the police would be too busy to even try.Pretty sure if you spend a couple hundred on an 8 ball and give it to some crab boat guys in exchange they dump your duffel bag of mysterious meat you'd get away with it pretty easily.Am I capable, no.

Would this help?FBI: I can't believe these people are just writing out how they would do it. Make sure to print these comments out and attach them to the folders we are building off the IPs we are getting.I could probably get away with murdering the guy who raped me when I was a child, if I orchestrated the right circumstances.\ud83e\udd14 I don\u2019t want to go into incriminating detail, though \ud83d\ude1d That way even if I get arrested and don\u2019t beat the charges, I may be in prison and not rich, but I\u2019d have the satisfaction of knowing a child rapist is dead. (Though in reality, it\u2019s likely he\u2019s already dead at the age he must be by now, with his health issues, so this is all just idle speculation and in no way an actual plan on my part.)Surely you just join any US police force? Conduct traffic stop and...Murder is really not that hard if you don't know the person being killed or have any reason to murder them.\n\nFind someone deserving of it like a child molester or rapist. Easy enough to look up court records they're public and sex offenders have to be on a registry. I would be looking for someone not local to me but probably not that far away so it isn't suspicious for me to spend time in that area to get their patterns. \n\nWatch their movements and habits for a week or two. Easy enough to do with 100m coming. Get a feel for where they're gonna be at what time, when they're alone. Etc. Plan out the best time and way to kill them. Prob late at night if they live alone.\n\nOnce decided on how and when, map out any cameras or potential witnesses to avoid. Steal a car or arrange some type of transportation to the area that can't be traced back to you. Have spare plates ready to swap with in case anyone clocks the car when you leave.\n\nI would probably look to do a close range kill with a firearm. Handgun is best. A 22 cal would be fine. Lightweight and small, zero recoil, very quiet as far as firearms go so won't draw much attention. Get up close and unload four or five rounds in the head. They don't have enough velocity to go out both sides of the skull so they tend to bounce around and do a lot of damage. \n\nObtaining the handgun wouldn't be impossible. They're cheap and I could technically get it legally. Not like they'd have any ballistics on file to match to my purchase. File down the serial number,  toss it when done. Will never be traced back to me. \n\nAlso can look into contacts to get a handgun illegally. I would know a few people I could ask for that. Handguns are a dime a dozen in the USA.\n\n\nAfter doing the deed just put the gun away and calmly walk away. Get in the stolen car, drive off to another area, switch plates real quick, then drive further to another spot where another car is waiting. Wipe down any surfaces, leave the car. Potentially set it on fire to remove any traces. Change clothes, bagging up everything I was wearing and burn all of it. Find a place to toss or bury the gun. Either a deep hole 6 feet plus or a deep body of water. Make sure the serial number is shaved off first if I purchase legally. Go home, super hot shower and scrub everything,  pretend like nothing happened. Receive my money.\n\nPolice will have absolutely nothing to go on with no motive or any way to tie me to the victim. I have no criminal history or motive. Even if there's an eyewitness it would be very hard to trace a vague sketch back to me without something to trace me down like my car. They would have very little desire to solve it anyways if it's a child molester.Public sex offender registries in the US make part of this easy. \n\nThe increasing number of doorbell and other surveillance cameras are the only real hurdle.I don\u2019t think I could do it. The guilt would prevent me from enjoying the money, because I know I\u2019d have to kill a random stranger, and likely someone who is already super unfortunate in life (maybe someone who is a homeless drug addict or something). That would just be so shitty, I couldn\u2019t live with myself after that. If I thought I could get away with killing someone who I consider deeply evil, maybe I could do that but even then I\u2019m not sure, plus I know I would never get away with it if it was someone well-known. No deal.I take that $100 million and buy the rights to a life saving drug.

The vast majority of first degree murders are by people who know the victim personally. If you live in a different state or country, used cash to get there (even if you bought the murder weapon with a credit card) and weren't in a super hurry to leave after doing it (Speeding out of town like a bat out of hell, buying a ticket and hopping in a plane or a bus within an hour), you'd probably never be caught.I mean if I did get away with it how would you know? \n\nI could have...

Stop the traveling, stop the carrying the ball, stop the moving screens. The players are getting away with murder, and I blame the officials.\"$$Rick Barry on NBA referees: \"Call the damn game according to the rulebook, because players will adjust. Stop the traveling, stop the carrying the ball, stop the moving screens. The players are getting away with murder, and I blame the officials.\"\nI wouldn\u2019t mind if they at least tried to enforce the rules.  It\u2019s gotten so out of hand.What bothers me is the unspoken rule that players have to earn the right to cheat. Young players that came from college or overseas try to play the game by the rules and get smoked by NBA veterans playing in clear violation of the rules, but when these same young players try they are whistled quickly.The moving screens is the most egregious to me. Players have never been better jump shooters, so allowing them to easily get open with the help of these moving screens is the biggest part of the scoring explosion I think. The worst part is the refs call it like 2 times a game, so they know what a moving screen looks like.He\u2019s right. Traveling and carrying been a issue since the late 90\u2019s and more recently I can\u2019t get over the number of moving screens. They\u2019re all moving!Yes yes and yes!He's 100% correct... players will def take the advantage if it's there, as they shouldThe carrying is out of control.I agree with what he says at the end bout PNRs lol. Lot of people probably not likely to agree with any of these older generations \u201ccomplaining\u201d bout new generation but damn. Too much leeway with offense, they really letting them do near anything out there to score.The officials call the game the way they've been instructed to by the head of officiating at the direction of the league itself.He's right. Dudes like Ja and LaMelo carry on every possession.\n\nIt's nasty to watch.Almost every screen is a moving screen nowadaysThe double step back is a travel. Call it.I seriously have no idea what traveling even is anymore. Whenever it does get called it's like... ok yeah that was clearly a travel, but what was different about that one from the 5 other times someone has done that and not gotten called this quarter?The fact is that if you tried to play like an NBA player on any local court you have stuff getting called on you the whole time. The NBA doesn\u2019t abide by its own rules and players have adapted to take advantage of that. It\u2019s lost a lot of fundamentals and gotten out of hand. I think there needs to be a changeYou literally cannot play defense when a super athletic guard is allowed to carry. How the fuck you stop that? It's impossible. This is the most important rule to implement, because you are going to have defense in the NBA and cleaner game. Moving screens and travels are called sometimes, but carrying.. Oh boy. NeverI've watched and played basketball my entire life, and the way players travel (constantly) is irritating. I can't even imagine how much this must chap Rick's hide watching today's game being played and (not) called.Totally agree, but I dont just blame the refs. I refuse to believe that the refs arent told by the league how to handle this sort of officiating.At the very least, if you see a player getting mugged in the paint call the foul. I don't wanna hear that \"Oh this player is so strong the contact doesn't effect him much so we don't call it\" bullshit. Call what you see.Rick Barry is a huge asshole and he is absolutely right hereThe NBA doesn\u2019t want enforcement. Their bookie overlords thrive on inconsistency because the refs can just decide to selectively call whatever, whenever.[deleted]They did carry and travel. The defense isn\u2019t rewarded anymore. Tbh I don\u2019t like an offensive-centric productStop putting Giannis travels on NBA top 10 highlights.The refs don't enforce it because the league doesn't want them to enforce it.\n\nThe NBA wants fast, offensive games. The league is about entertainment, not the sanctity of the sport. That's what the olympics are supposed to be for.Unfortunately this is old news lol try and play like an nba player on any local court, you will get called out because what they play is a different type of basketballNot a single lie told.The carrying and moving screens (to facilitate 3 chucking) is the absolute worst.My main issue with it is it devalues really good defensive players. Every possession feels like watching penalty kicks in soccer, in that it's more about hoping the shooter misses than the defender stopping themIm sooooo fucking tired of watching dudes travel and carry the ball. The screens are a thing too, but not nearly like the traveling and carrying. It is such an unfair advantage when a player on offense can literally carry and palm the ball whenever the fuck they want.On point, the refs have gotten completely out of control and I have no doubt they are owned by the bookies now. It\u2019s made it hard to watch this season.next week it's my turn to post thisI wonder why the NBA is so opposed to doing this, do they really think doing so would negatively impact the sport? It's just anecdotal but my dad and almost all of his friends have stopped watching the NBA because of this. They all still like the NCAA tho, so it's not like they just hate basketball.This is an old videoRefs when Nurkic sets a moving screen: \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc41\nRefs when Draymond sets a moving screen: \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83e\uddaf\ud83d\ude48I wanna hear Barry call a game. He sounds wonderfully smart and knowledgeableBlaming the refs is such a short sighted way of viewing this, clearly this is how the league wants games to be officiated. If you want tighter rules appeal this to the league, not the refs who are just following league orders.They tried calling travels and carries but the play was getting interrupted with every trip down the court so I think they stopped it lol.\n\nNice try NBA.FactsRick Barry was an amazing player, HOF'er. When we look at today we think this person or that person is better. We have no idea what that person would have been in Barry's days with the rules he played under and what Barry would have been in today's NBA with it's current ruleset. He at least would have been more awesome and I'm telling you he was already super awesome, he was Larry Bird before Bird, he didn't save the league, it wasn't the right time for that, in fact he had to bounce between leagues a lot.\n\nI know when I look at 50-60's bbal, I get a back ache just watching it, but the rules made you dribble like your hand was a ping pong paddle. They would have been a lot smoother if they could carry etc, the male anatomy hasn't evolved much at all in 50 years, the rules have.\n\nThis doesn't mean I'm for or against the current rules, just saying they are so radically different, it freed the player from ping pong paddle hand bondage AND TO BE FAIR, it was already changing when he played, it was laxed from the 50's.Wasn\u2019t this like two years agoThe traveling is so egregious. I watched lebron take at least 6 steps before dribbling once.Y'all got the same problem as the NHL. Refs determining the flow of the game instead of calling the rules. Absolute trash.Hire refs from Euroleague and they'll stop that shit quicklyI like how everyone is blaming the refs when the league itself is letting them do it. It\u2019s like blaming the employees for their bosses decisions.Bigger the star, the quieter the whistle.NBA basketball will always be an inferior product until this is dealt with meaningfully. I often wonder why the players even need to dribble the ball in the first placeAs a defender it\u2019s so unfair. Being allowed to switch your pivot foot is where the problem lies. It makes defending almost impossible.1000% RIGHT\n\nIt's pathetic and watching sometimes you're just wondering what kind of basketball is this?\n\nI think the instructions must come from above the officials, their bosses clearly don't see any wrongdoingYeah that won\u2019t sell. It\u2019s entertainment at this point.My tinfoil conspiracy theory is that the refs don't do this because it allows them to more easily influence games when they want to.\n\nDon't call a travel all season, then start calling it because you need the under to hit? Done. Need to stop a certain player's production? Done. \n\nRefs don't call the games strictly so when they want to influence the game unscrupulously, they can do so under the guise of being \"fair\".Warriors won 4 championships off of moving screens. Don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever stop ignoring itSo many non basketball fans who would rather watch 48 mins of ankle breakers, 360 windmill dunks, and 40ft uncontested 3 pointers. The NBA is driven by those most entertaining to its audienceStraight up Rick. I think the 3 steps bother me more than anything. More than the travels and more than the carries. Like they blatantly take 3 steps! Sometimes they do the shit so slow you can\u2019t help but see it and the refs let it go.100%What is called in a particular game doesn't bother me as much as it's always....\"Who the fuck knows?\"\n\nI just want consistency. I've always been that way. \"The refs are letting them play\" or \"It's playoff time now, where the games are called differently\" have always bugged me.\n\nIF something is a foul or turnover-worthy in November, it should be called EXACTLY the same way in June. No, I don't buy that \"it's the playoffs now.\" Because, that means what? We can relax the rules? Meaning that ticky tack shit didn't need to be called? If it didn't need to be called, then DON'T CALL IT IN DECEMBER. \n\nNo one pays to watch the refs.Blaming the officials is cheap.\n\nNotice how occasionally the whistles come out in burst for the same thing? They're told to look for certain things and ignore others and to also manage \"flow of the game\". \n\nIf officials started \"calling the damn game\", this place (as well as sports talk radio and podcasts and other media) would be full of comments like \"got my Tony Brothers jersey\", \"no one is here to see refball\", etc. And the NBA owners and league administration knows this and instructs refs accordingly.  \n\nEveryone wants them to call by the rulebook until you get whistles every play. Then \"refs are inserting themselves into the game and no one is here to see them\".Straight spitting truth, love Rick Barry, and his children, although no where near his talent also made it into the league because he taught them how to play basketball properly.blame the nba/adam silver not the refs.\n\nthe refs are calling what they're told to call.The NBA has become unwatchable to me the last 5 years. All the traveling, carrying, moving screens, etc has just led to a hideous and ridiculous style of \u201cbasketball\u201d. It\u2019s truly unbelievable that the refs/the league have let the game get to this point.\"Now if you don't mind, I need to pull my tube socks up to shin level and go shoot some underhanded free throws like a god damn MAN!\"the game is so broken. the product is seriously so terrible now. the only purpose of the game is to trick refs and get FTs. i'm so sick of 90 FTs and 90 3s a game with all the FT ads and long ass timeouts for ads.\nball handler is constantly pushing and elbowing defenders and getting FTs. defenders can't do shit.\nit's just a cash grab league now. it's pathetic.Having grown up watching basketball in the 90s and early 2000s, coming back now trying to get into it has been a bit of a struggle. Like Rick said, the talent in the league is the highest it\u2019s ever been, but the style of play and lack of rule enforcement really kills it for me. Defense is nearly non existent. Players get fouls called for lightly brushing an opponent, traveling, moving screens, positionless play. It feels less like like a cohesive team sport and more like iso ball all the time. And don\u2019t even get me started on the three pointers. I understand that shooting threes has become accepted as the more efficient way to play the game, but watching players on fast breaks just run up and stop at the 3 point line to jack up a shot is so much less interesting than watching a team play lob pass into a spectacular dunk. Maybe I\u2019m just biased, but I think the league needs to make some serious decisions about what to do moving forward before the nba turns even more degenerate.The famously levelheaded and likable Rick Barry.Correct take.He's right. But this sub is full of apologist morons who defend how frequent travelling goes uncalled in the NBA.I used to be an NBA diehard. Watched the pistons beat the lakers in person, and was also at the malice at the palace game. I just can\u2019t stand to watch it anymore. Only commenting because this showed up on r/all. Rick Barry is 100% right.It's not going to happen, highlights are what sells and all people want to see now, if everything is called correctly then everyone is probably going to foul outDev In The Lab is smiling wherever he is.My pet peeve is offensive players using their arms like battering rams. Like dudes push off defenders all the time to get space or when they're going down the lane and it never gets called. How the fuck are you supposed to play defense when the offensive player can just elbow you the fuck out of the way?The annoying part is the seemingly arbitrary nature of enforcement. I'm fine with travels and moving picks not being called (tho I'd prefer if they were), but good lord they need to pick a lane. The fact that refs can literally decide the outcome of games by elective enforcement of these rules is ridiculous. \n\nWhen the superstars get called for 12 travels a game will it hurt the product for a few months? Yeah. But people will adjust. Having these initiatives in which they call 1 of every 5 travels for a couple weeks and back off just annoy everyone and have no tangible effect other than confusing people and screwing up games. We want consistent application and enforcement, whatever direction that is.So much truth, stopped watching a lot of games altogether because of the egregious carrying, traveling and moving screens.Nobody cares what Rick Berry says. We all know what he really wants to say.The moving screens are the big thing. People complain about the 3 pt boom and a big reason for that is centers are basically allowed to check guys while shuffling their feet constantly to create an open shot or a mismatch. If you called moving screens more consistently the NBA would be a better productI saw a video where NBA stars would give death glares to officials in international play because they couldn't get the cheap calls they got stateside.NBA officials are officially a bunch of star fuckers. Call. The. Game.Do you feel it?? That unwelcome, uncomfortable sensation when the worst person you know makes a good point.I dont think they can do it overnight realistically, it would have to be like what they did with foul baiting. Tell the teams after the season and set a clear deadline for when it will be enforced, and re-train the refs.As long as it's consistent player to player, team to team, I got no problem. Old heads can hate."]
